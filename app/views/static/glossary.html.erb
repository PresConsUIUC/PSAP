    <dd>An early era photographic print with no binder or baryta layer&mdash;simply image material on a paper support&mdash;is given this designation (popularized by James Reilly). Examples include the Salt Print, Cyanotype, and Platinum/Palladium Print.</dd>

    <dt id="2-layer_print">2-layer print</dt>
    <dd>An early era photographic print with no baryta layer&mdash;simply image material in a binder layer on a paper support&mdash;is given this designation (popularized by James Reilly). Examples include the Albumen Print, Carbon Print, and Woodburytype (also regarded as a Photomechanical process).</dd>

    <dt id="3-layer_print">3-layer print</dt>
    <dd>An early era photographic print with a baryta layer, binder, and image material on a paper support&mdash;is given this designation (popularized by James Reilly). Examples include the glossy Collodion Print, Matte Collodion Print, Gelatin POP Print, and Silver Gelatin Print.</dd>

    <h2 id="A">A</h2>

    <dt id="Access_copy">Access copy, or Reference copy</dt>
    <dd>A restored copy of an item, or a clone, imitation, or duplicate copy of an item that is available for public use.</dd>

    <dt id="Access_restriction">Access restriction</dt>
    <dd>A limitation on the access to or use of materials. Access restrictions may be determined by a period of time or by a class of individual as to protect national security, personal privacy, or to preserve materials.</dd>

    <dt id="Accession">Accession</dt>
    <dd>1.) Materials physically and legally transferred to a repository as a unit at a single time; an acquisition.</dd>
    <dd>2.) To take legal and physical custody of a group of records or other materials and to formally document their receipt.</dd>
    <dd>3.) To document the transfer of records or materials in a register, database, or other log of the repository's holdings (Pearce-Moses, 2005).</dd>

    <dt id="Accession_number">Accession number</dt>
    <dd>A number or code assigned to uniquely identify a group of records or materials acquired by a repository and used to link the materials to associated records (Pearce-Moses, 2005).</dd>

    <dt id="Acetate">Acetate</dt>
    <dd>A transparent plastic base for photographic film made by treating cellulose with acetic acid. This term is used for various modifications of cellulose acetate, e.g., cellulose diacetate, cellulose triacetate, cellulose acetate propionate, and cellulose acetate butyrate. Also referred to as "safety" film, because, as opposed to nitrate film, acetate is nonflammable. That said, acetate suffers from its own form of chemical deterioration (see <a href="#Acetate_decay">Acetate decay</a>).</dd>

    <dt id="Acetate_decay">Acetate decay (vinegar syndrome)</dt>
    <dd>Chemical degradation of cellulose acetate film base that may cause distortion, shrinkage, and brittleness. Accelerated by high humidity and temperature, it is often detected by a vinegar odor. The severity of decomposition can be determined using <a href="#A-D_Strips">A-D Strips</a>.</dd>

    <dt id="Acetate_disc">Acetate disc</dt>
    <dd>See <a href="#Lacquer_disc">Lacquer disc</a>.</dd>

    <dt id="Acid">Acid</dt>
    <dd>Property of an item with a pH below 7.0. Some paper materials may become acidic as they age. Acidity is often a characteristic of older papers made from wood-based pulp that has not had its lignin removed. Acidic material will yellow over time, become brittle, and cause the pH of items in proximity to shift toward acidic pH levels. Exposure to light or heat hastens deterioration.</dd>

    <dt id="Acid-free">Acid-free</dt>
    <dd>Term used to describe paper and plastic products (and archival storage and display materials) with pH equal to 7.0 (neutral) or greater than 7.0 (alkaline). Slightly acidic paper (6.0–7.0 pH) is also sometimes called "acid-free." It was the creation of alkaline sizing in the 1950s that ultimately led to acid-free wood-based pulp papers. Acid-free enclosure products must be free of acid, lignin, alum, and sulfur. "Acid-free" does not necessarily mean that the material will maintain this pH over time.</dd>

    <dt id="Adhesive">Adhesive</dt>
    <dd>A substance, either organic or synthetic, which bonds the surfaces of two other materials through chemical and/or mechanical means. The term "adhesive" may be used interchangeably with glue, cement, or paste. Pressure-sensitive tape adhesives are of particular concern when it comes to paper, book, and photo collections.</dd>

    <dt id="A-D_Strips">A-D Strips</dt>
    <dd>Indicator papers, manufactured by Image Permanence Institute (IPI), which change color when acetic acid is produced by degrading cellulose acetate base.</dd>

    <dt id="Alkaline">Alkaline</dt>
    <dd>Property of an item to produce a basic pH (pH &gt;7.0). An alkaline reserve is added to some paper materials (called buffered papers) during manufacture intended to neutralize acid compounds contained in older papers.</dd>

    <dt id="Alum-rosin_sizing">Alum-rosin sizing</dt>
    <dd>Method of sizing papers, rendering them more suitable for printing/writing by reducing liquid absorption capacity (no ink bleed/run). Alum-rosin was commonly used from the 1850s through the 1980s. Though effective, it is considered an "inherent vice" of papers of this era, as it lowered the paper’s pH and set the stage for browning/yellowing and embrittlement.</dd>

    <dt id="Analog">Analog</dt>
    <dd>An electrical signal that varies continuously; comes from the word "analogous," which means "similar to." All early AV recordings were analog (National Film and Sound Archive, 2007).</dd>

    <dt id="Analog_recording">Analog recording</dt>
    <dd>1.) A method of recording in which a characteristic of the recorded current, such as amplitude or frequency, is continuously varied in a manner analogous to the variations of the original signal. </dd>
    <dd>2.) A logging of an event by one of various methods of capturing and storing a continuous replica of the source sound pattern by tracing an analogous pattern into another medium. The most commonly used storage methods have been engraved or embossed modulated grooves in a disc, magnetic particle patterns in tape, and optical patterns in film (Miliano & IASA, 1999). </dd>
    <dd>3.) A recording in which continuous magnetic signals, which are representations of the voltage signals from the video camera or microphone, are written to tape. Analog signals stored on tape deteriorate with each copy or generation (in contrast, see Digital) (Bay Area Video Coalition, 2009).</dd>

    <dt id="Analog-to-digital">Analog-to-digital</dt>
    <dd>The process in which a continuous analog signal is quantized and converted to a series of binary integers (Bay Area Video Coalition, 2009). Also referred to as A-D.</dd>

    <dt id="Aniline_dye">Aniline dye</dt>
    <dd>Type of dye used in colored inks. Aniline dye was invented in 1856 and is derived from coal tar. Aniline ink is light sensitive and water-soluble. Aniline ink will commonly be violet or blue, but may be assumed to be in any color ink for documents and copies produced after the mid-1800s.</dd>

    <dt id="Archival_quality">Archival quality</dt>
    <dd>A generic term used by the paper industry to indicate that a product (usually a housing or display material) is durable and will not cause harm to original collection materials. "Archival" often means acid-free, but that is not an absolute. Note that the term "archival" may be used indiscriminately by manufacturers to describe their products and does not necessarily guarantee that the product meets ISO or ANSI guidelines.</dd>

    <dt id="Audiovisual_artifact">Audiovisual artifact</dt>
    <dd>An undesirable picture element in a video image, which may naturally occur in the recording process and must be eliminated in order to achieve a high quality image.

    <dt id="Baking">Baking (videotape)</dt>
    <dd>The process of gently heating damaged videotape in an oven in order to enable playback. The polymer of the magnetic tape's binder deteriorates by hydrolysis, resulting in sticky shed syndrome. Archivists have reported success in baking tapes that are suffering from severe sticky shed syndrome; however, scientific research has not been conducted to explain this. The temperature and humidity of the oven must be tightly controlled, as well as the time in which a tape is baked. This process is not recommended except in extreme circumstances, as it may accelerate the deterioration of the tape. When a tape is baked successfully, it can usually be played back one time for remastering (Bay Area Video Coalition, 2009).</dd>

    <dt id="Backprint">Backprint</dt>
    <dd>An inked logo or manufacturer/brand information on the back side of a photo paper. Though there are exceptions, backprinting was a common practice for some manufacturers (Agfa, Kodak) and today provide clues about the print’s origin.</dd>

    <dd>See <a href="#Monochrome">Monochrome</a>.</dd>

    <dt id="Baryta">Baryta</dt>
    <dd>A coating of barium sulfate in gelatin applied to the surface of photographic paper base to provide opacity, smoothness, and brightness. Barium sulfate is a chemically stable white pigment. Part of the weight and stiffness of a photo paper is due to the baryta undercoating, which is primarily intended to provide a smooth, pure white, inert base for the emulsion.</dd>

    <dt id="Binder_hydrolysis">Binder hydrolysis</dt>
    <dd>See <a href="#Sticky_shed_syndrome">Sticky shed syndrome</a>.</dd>

    <dt id="Bit">Bit (Binary digit)</dt>
    <dd>The smallest unit of information in a binary system. A number in base 2, which can be represented using only two numeric symbols: a zero and one (National Film and Sound Archive, 2007). Eight bits equals one byte. There are 256 possible combinations for eight binary digits; thus, the color depth of eight bits represents 256 possible colors (2&#215;2&#215;2&#215;2&#215;2&#215;2&#215;2&#215;2). Because each pixel of a video picture contains 3 samples (Y', R-Y', B-Y'), there are 16.7 million (256 &#215; 256 &#215; 256) possible colors in an 8-bit system (Bay Area Video Coalition, 2009).</dd>

      <p><em>NOTE:</em> In the United States, copyright is provided for by the Constitution (Article I, Section 8) and is codified by the Copyright Act of 1976, 17 USC 101-1332. Internationally, copyright is defined by the Berne Convention, which the United States joined in 1989. Copyright protects the owner's interests in the intellectual property (content), rather than in the physical property that serves as a container for the content. For example, an archives may own a collection of papers, but the author retains copyright. As property, copyright can be transferred or inherited; hence, the owner of a work's copyright may not be the work's creator. These works may be in a wide range of media, including literary works; musical works, including any accompanying words; dramatic works, including any accompanying music; pantomimes and choreographic works; pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works; motion pictures and other audiovisual works; sound recordings; and architectural works. Copyright does not protect any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery in such works; it only protects their tangible manifestation (Pearce-Moses, 2005).</p>

If the binder loses integrity&mdash;through softening, embrittlement, loss of cohesiveness, or loss of lubrication&mdash;the tape may become unplayable. Sticky tape and sticky shed syndrome are commonly used terms to describe the phenomenon associated with the deterioration of the magnetic tape binder (Bay Area Video Coalition, 2009). </dd>

    <dt id="Developing-out_paper">Developing-out paper (DOP)</dt>
    <dd>A photographic paper which forms a visible image through the use of a chemical developer to reveal the latent image made by exposure to light. DOP prints are cool in color—blue, neutral, or black—unless they have been toned. They may be either contact-printed or enlarged from a negative.</dd>

    <dt id="Diazo_microform">Diazo (microform)</dt>
    <dd>A microfilm duplication process intended for service copies. Unlike silver-gelatin microfilm, diazo is not regarded as preservation quality, though it is capable of producing color. Diazonium salts in the film emulsion combine with dye couplers to produce strong, dense colors. May be on either an acetate or polyester base.</dd>

    <dt id="Digital">Digital</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Representing information through a sequence of discrete units, especially binary code.</p>
      <p><em>NOTE:</em> "Digital" is distinguished from "analog," the latter representing information as a continuous signal. Often used as a synonym of automated, computerized, electronic, or the prefix e-. "Digital" and "electronic" are often used synonymously, although "electronic" may include analog as well as digital formats (Pearce-Moses, 2005).</p>
    </dd>

    <dt id="Digital_preservation">Digital preservation</dt>
    <dd>The process of maintaining, in a condition suitable for use, materials produced in digital formats, including preservation of the bit stream and the continued ability to render or display the content represented by the bit stream. The task is compounded by the fact that some digital storage media deteriorate quickly ("bit rot"), and the digital object is inextricably entwined with its access environment (software and hardware), which is evolving in a continuous cycle of innovation and obsolescence. Also refers to the practice of digitizing materials originally produced in non-digital formats (print, film, etc.) to prevent permanent loss due to deterioration of the physical medium (Reitz, 2007).</dd>

    <dt id="Digitization">Digitization</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>The process of transforming analog material into binary electronic (digital) form, especially for storage and use in a computer. The word "digitized" distinguishes materials that have been transformed from the media in which they were created from materials that are born digital. Digitization is distinguished from "data entry," which is the process of typing textual records, often in forms designed to facilitate the process, into a computer system.</p>
      <p>Digitization may start with information that is in electronic or physical form, for example magnetic audio tape or phonograph discs. Digitization of textual documents typically produces an image of the words, which must be transformed into character data through a process of optical character recognition (OCR). In some instances, the OCR process may preserve text and page formatting (Pearce-Moses, 2005).</p>

The fabric is typically cotton or linen, starched and calendered to create a smooth drawing surface.</dd>

    <dt id="Drafting_film">Drafting film</dt>
    <dd>Plastic drafting film was the preferred support for large-scale technical drawings from the 1980s–2000s (Lowell & Nelb, 2006). Drafting films will have a matte finish on one or both sides, which gives the surface "teeth" to accept media (pencil, ink) or emulsion. Like other translucent supports, drafting film may be used alternately for original drawings or as a reproductive intermediate. Film composition maybe either acetate or polyester (or Mylar).</dd>

    <dt id="DVD">DVD (abbreviation for Digital Versatile Disc)</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>There are a number of different types of DVDs, which include DVD-R, DVD-ROM, DVD-RAM, DVD+RW, and DVD-RW. DVD is not a suitable archival format for video, mainly because it uses a lossy form of compression (MPEG2). It is also a format that is likely to see rapid changes in technology, which makes the risk of its obsolescence very high. DVDs are made up of a reflective aluminum layer, a polycarbonate substrate, a dye layer, and a clear lacquer layer. While the aluminum layer is highly susceptible to pollution, the lacquer layer does not sufficiently protect it from oxidizing. Double sided DVDs are bonded using an adhesive—the life expectancy of which is unknown. A DVD is the same diameter as a CD (120cm) but cannot be read by the same equipment. DVDs and CDs both encode data as tiny pits in tracks that correspond to the zeros and ones of binary digits. A laser reads and plays back the information encoded on the pits. DVDs are able to store more data than CDs by making the pits smaller, the tracks closer together, and by compressing the data using MPEG2. DVD-R discs were introduced in 1997 with a 3.95 GB capacity and a track pitch of 0.8 microns; the capacity was later increased to 4.7 GB by reducing the track pitch to 0.74 microns.</p>
      <p>Many artists now use DVD-R as an exhibition format, which has replaced laser disc as a popular display format for many museums and galleries. However, because of the way the data is encoded, it cannot achieve frame accurate control to reference the picture content (as it can with laser disc). Where external control is needed for display, it is important clarify any specific requirements of the control system before having the disc(s) made.</p>
      <p>There are two types of DVD-R discs: "General" and "Authoring." This has caused some compatibility issues, as the lasers in the discs' players need to be angled differently. Professional DVD players will have both lasers; however if you are using a domestic model, it is important to check which discs your player is compatible with. This is also true for all other types of discs. DVD is a rapidly developing technology and there is a continued push to increase the amount of data that can be stored on a disc (Bay Area Video Coalition, 2009).</p>

    <dt id="Snow">Snow</dt>
    <dd>White flashes appearing in the video image caused by random noise and/or loss of magnetic particles (Bay Area Video Coalition, 2009).</dd>

    <dt id="Softcover">Softcover (or Softback, Paperback)</dt>
    <dd>Type of book or bound volume with a flexible cover/case, typically of thick paper or paper board. Pages are often joined (bound) with adhesive, staples, or other hardware (wire, comb, etc.) rather than sewn, so it is therefore assumed more vulnerable to wear and tear. If mass-produced, a paperback will very likely be composed of acidic paper. See the <%= link_to 'Bound/Book', format_id_guide_category_path('bookbound'), target: '_blank' %> profile in the Format ID Guide for more.</dd>

    <dt id="Squeal">Squeal</dt>
    <dd>Undesirable audio effect that is typically caused by a buildup of debris on a guide or head. Sometimes, cleaning the offending surface will eliminate the squeal. Squeal is also caused by the tape having poor lubrication or losing its lubrication with age. Coating a tape with a lubricant solution may eliminate the squeal so a copy can be made (Bay Area Video Coalition, 2009).</dd>

    <dt id="Staging_area">Staging area</dt>
    <dd>A room set at a temperature and humidity level between that of the cold vault and the workroom. Film is acclimated in the staging area before it is moved to a new environment (NFPF, 2004).</dd>

    <dt id="Stencil_printing">Stencil printing</dt>
    <dd>Printing method in which the ink image is forced through a stencil onto the printing surface. Examples include mimeograph (stencil copy) and screen printing.</dd>

    <dt id="Stick_slip">Stick slip</dt>
    <dd>The process in which 1.) the tape sticks to the recording head because of high friction; 2.) the tape tension builds because the tape is not moving at the head; 3.) the tape tension level reaches a critical level, causing the tape to release from and briefly slip past the read head at high speed; 4.) the tape slows to normal speed and once again sticks to the recording head. It is a process that is repeated indefinitely and is characterized by jittery movement of the tape in the transport and/or audible squealing of the tape (Bay Area Video Coalition, 2009).</dd>

    <dt id="Sticky_shed_syndrome">Sticky shed syndrome (Binder hydrolysis)</dt>
    <dd>A condition resulting from the deterioration of the binder in magnetic tape that results in gummy residues on tape heads during playback (Pearce-Moses, 2005). The phenomenon whereby a tape binder has deteriorated to such a degree that it lacks sufficient cohesive strength so that the magnetic coating sheds on playback. The shedding of particles by the tape is a result of binder deterioration that causes dropout on VHS tapes (Bay Area Video Coalition, 2009).</dd>

    <dt id="Streaming">Streaming (media)</dt>
    <dd>A technology for transferring data so that it can be received and processed in a steady stream (Dictonary.com, n.d.). A method of sending a sequence of compressed audio or moving images one way over a data network, at the user's request or broadcast at a fixed time, which allows listening/viewing to begin before the entire file has been transmitted. To counteract any delays caused by packet switching and to maintain the impression of continuous motion, a buffer on the client computer is used to store a few seconds of content before it is displayed on the screen. Unlike content that is downloaded for subsequent playback, streaming audio/video is stored as a temporary file and deleted when the application used to view it is closed. Videoconferencing differs from streaming video in providing two-way transmission in real time (Reitz, 2007).</dd>

    <dt id="Substrate">Substrate (audiovisual)</dt>

    <dd>Type of leather made from the underside of softer animal skins (lamb, goat, calf) or produced through splitting the hides of thicker cow or deer skins. Suede does not include the exterior skin layer, so it is therefore softer and more delicate than full-grain leather—"fuzzy" texture on both sides.</dd>

    <dt id="Support">Support</dt>

    <dt id="Thermoplastic_adhesive">Thermoplastic adhesive (Heat-sensitive)</dt>
    <dd>Type of adhesive activated, i.e. rendered into a pliable and sticky liquid, when heated above a specific temperature. As it cools, it "sets," returning to its original solid form, though some may remain tacky at room temperature. Heat sensitive adhesives of this type are broad and include waxes, resins (natural or synthetic), some acrylics, and proprietary heat-set mending tissue adhesives.</dd>

    <dt id="Thermoset_adhesive">Thermoset adhesive</dt>

    <dt id="Tinted_paper">Tinted paper</dt>
    <dd>A tinted photo will have a single overall color, or tint, throughout the photographic image though most apparent in highlights and midtones. The dyes (impregnated within the emulsion or binder by the paper manufacturer) have likely faded considerably over time. Popular colors included pale pink, blue, and mauve in albumen print papers and gelatin silver printing-out papers. Not to be confused with hand-colored.</dd>

    <dt id="Titanium_dioxide">Titanium dioxide</dt>
    <dd>A base whitener added to resin-coated photographic papers. The titanium dioxide (TiO2) pigment is layered on the emulsion side of the polyethylene resin, setting an opacity and brightness, serving the same function of the baryta layer in a fiber-based print. </dd>

    <dt id="Toning">Toning</dt>
    <dd>A monochromatic, silver-based photo image may have been colored during and/or after processing using mineral toning. A print categorized as "B&W" may contain accents such as gold, selenium, sulfur, or platinum to produce specific hues and increase image contrast. Resulting tones vary, depending on the minerals used:  most have a brown overtone with purple and violet undertones, though sometimes a purple/violet hue is unmistakable. Toning has also proven to enhance the stability of images in many cases, particularly gold and selenium.</dd>

    <dt id="Tracing_paper">Tracing paper</dt>
    <dd>Semi-translucent paper conventionally used for trace-copying technical drawings. Another drawing serves as the master original from which the copy is reproduced. Some especially thin translucent papers also functioned as intermediary for photo-reproductions of drawings. Tracing paper is defined as such because of its function rather than a specific manufacture, as any low-opacity paper will allow for tracing.</dd>

    <dt id="Tracking">Tracking</dt>
    <dd>The angle and speed at which the tape passes through the video heads. Loss of tracking is evidenced by picture breakup or loss of video in segments of the picture. </dd>

    <dt id="Vesicular">Vesicular</dt>
    <dd>A microfilm duplicate process intended for service copies. Unlike silver-gelatin microfilm, vesicular is not regarded as preservation quality, but permit relatively quick in-house processing. Diazonium salts in the emulsion are sandwiched between two polyester layers. During processing, expanding nitrogen forms tiny bubbles (or vesicles) in exposed areas that remain after the film is cooled. The image is formed by heating the film to form these bubbles or "vesicles" inside the film.</dd>
