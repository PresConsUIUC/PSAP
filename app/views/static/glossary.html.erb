    <dd>A restored copy of an item, or a clone, imitation, or duplicate copy of an item that is available for public use.</dd>

    <dt id ="access_restriction">Access restriction</dt>
    <dd>A limitation on the access to or use of materials. Access restrictions may be determined by a period of time or by a class of individual as to protect national security, personal privacy, or to preserve materials.</dd>

    <dt id ="accession">Accession</dt>
    <dd>1.) Materials physically and legally transferred to a repository as a unit at a single time; an acquisition.</dd>
    <dd>2.) To take legal and physical custody of a group of records or other materials and to formally document their receipt.</dd>
    <dd>3.) To document the transfer of records or materials in a register, database, or other log of the repository's holdings (Pearce-Moses, 2005).</dd>

    <dt id ="accession_number">Accession number</dt>
    <dd>A number or code assigned to uniquely identify a group of records or materials acquired by a repository and used to link the materials to associated records (Pearce-Moses, 2005).</dd>

    <dt id ="acetate">Acetate</dt>
    <dd>A transparent plastic base for photographic film made by treating cellulose with acetic acid. This term is used for various modifications of cellulose acetate, e.g., cellulose diacetate, cellulose triacetate, cellulose acetate propionate, and cellulose acetate butyrate. Also referred to as "safety" film, because, as opposed to nitrate film, acetate is nonflammable. That said, acetate suffers from its own form of chemical deterioration (see <a href="#acetate_decay">Acetate decay</a>).</dd>

    <dt id ="acetate_decay">Acetate decay (vinegar syndrome)</dt>
    <dd>Chemical degradation of cellulose acetate film base that may cause distortion, shrinkage, and brittleness. Accelerated by high humidity and temperature, it is often detected by a vinegar odor. The severity of decomposition can be determined using <a href="#a-d_strips">A-D Strips</a>.</dd>

    <dt id ="acetate_disc">Acetate disc</dt>
    <dd>See <a href="#lacquer_disc">Lacquer disc</a>.</dd>

    <dt id ="acetic_acid">Acetic Acid</dt>
    <dd>An acid released by unpainted wood that can cause metal corrosion.</dd>

    <dt id ="acid">Acid</dt>
    <dd>Property of an item with a pH below 7.0. Some paper materials may become acidic as they age. Acidity is often a characteristic of older papers made from wood-based pulp that has not had its lignin removed. Acidic material will yellow over time, become brittle, and cause the pH of items in proximity to shift toward acidic pH levels. Exposure to light or heat hastens deterioration.</dd>

    <dt id ="acid_etching">Acid Etching</dt>
    <dd>Type of decoration on glass which is produced through exposure of the surface of the glass to hydrofluoric acid. The glass item is first covered in an acid-resistant material, sometimes a wax, before the acid is used to scratch through that material. The item is then immersed in hydrofluoric acid. A patent for the acid-etching process was filed in 1857 by Richardson's, an English glass company.</dd>

    <dt id ="acid_free">Acid-free</dt>
    <dd>Term used to describe paper and plastic products (and archival storage and display materials) with pH equal to 7.0 (neutral) or greater than 7.0 (alkaline). Slightly acidic paper (6.0 - 7.0 pH) is also sometimes called "acid-free." It was the creation of alkaline sizing in the 1950s that ultimately led to acid-free wood-based pulp papers. Acid-free enclosure products must be free of acid, lignin, alum, and sulfur. "Acid-free" does not necessarily mean that the material will maintain this pH over time.</dd>

    <dt id ="a-d_strips">A-D Strips</dt>
    <dd>Indicator papers, manufactured by Image Permanence Institute (IPI), which change color when acetic acid is produced by degrading cellulose acetate base.</dd>

    <dt id ="adhesive">Adhesive</dt>
    <dd>A substance, either organic or synthetic, which bonds the surfaces of two other materials through chemical and/or mechanical means. The term "adhesive" may be used interchangeably with glue, cement, or paste. Pressure-sensitive tape adhesives are of particular concern when it comes to paper, book, and photo collections.</dd>

    <dt id ="adobe">Adobe</dt>
    <dd>A clay mixture that has been dried to harden, but is not fired.</dd>

    <dt id ="alabaster">Alabaster</dt>
    <dd>An extremely soft, wax-like type of stone.</dd>

    <dt id ="alkaline">Alkaline</dt>
    <dd>Property of an item to produce a basic pH (pH >7.0). An alkaline reserve is added to some paper materials (called buffered papers) during manufacture intended to neutralize acid compounds contained in older papers.</dd>

    <dt id ="alloy">Alloy</dt>
    <dd>A metal made by combining two or more metallic elements. Often used to improve a metal's strength or resistance to corrosion.</dd>

    <dt id ="aluminum">Aluminum</dt>
    <dd>A type of metal that is silver-white in color and has a very reflective, flat sheen. Aluminum is easily formed and manipulated.</dd>

    <dt id ="alum_rosin_sizing">Alum-rosin sizing</dt>
    <dd>Method of sizing papers, rendering them more suitable for printing/writing by reducing liquid absorption capacity (no ink bleed/run). Alum-rosin was commonly used from the 1850s through the 1980s. Though effective, it is considered an "inherent vice" of papers of this era, as it lowered the paper's pH and set the stage for browning/yellowing and embrittlement.</dd>

    <dt id ="alveolization">Alveolization</dt>
    <dd>Alveoles are symmetrical cavities that can form in soft stones such as limestone, usually as the result of weathering. Alveolization sometimes occurs in an interconnected "honeycomb" pattern.</dd>

    <dd>A noncrystalline solid having neither a definite form nor an apparent structure.</dd>

    <dt id ="analog">Analog</dt>
    <dd>An electrical signal that varies continuously; comes from the word "analogous," which means "similar to." All early AV recordings were analog (National Film and Sound Archive, 2007).</dd>

    <dt id ="analog_recording">Analog recording</dt>
    <dd>1.) A method of recording in which a characteristic of the recorded current, such as amplitude or frequency, is continuously varied in a manner analogous to the variations of the original signal. </dd>
    <dd>2.) A logging of an event by one of various methods of capturing and storing a continuous replica of the source sound pattern by tracing an analogous pattern into another medium. The most commonly used storage methods have been engraved or embossed modulated grooves in a disc, magnetic particle patterns in tape, and optical patterns in film (Miliano & IASA, 1999). </dd>
    <dd>3.) A recording in which continuous magnetic signals, which are representations of the voltage signals from the video camera or microphone, are written to tape. Analog signals stored on tape deteriorate with each copy or generation (in contrast, see Digital) (Bay Area Video Coalition, 2009).</dd>

    <dt id ="analog_to_digital">Analog-to-digital</dt>
    <dd>The process in which a continuous analog signal is quantized and converted to a series of binary integers (Bay Area Video Coalition, 2009). Also referred to as A-D.</dd>

    <dt id ="aniline_dye">Aniline dye</dt>
    <dd>Type of dye used in colored inks. Aniline dye was invented in 1856 and is derived from coal tar. Aniline ink is light sensitive and water-soluble.

    <dt id ="archival_quality">Archival quality</dt>
    <dd>A generic term used by the paper industry to indicate that a product (usually a housing or display material) is durable and will not cause harm to original collection materials. "Archival" often means acid-free, but that is not an absolute. Note that the term "archival" may be used indiscriminately by manufacturers to describe their products and does not necessarily guarantee that the product meets ISO or ANSI guidelines.</dd>

    <dt id ="audiovisual_artifact">Audiovisual artifact</dt>
    <dd>An undesirable picture element in a video image, which may naturally occur in the recording process and must be eliminated in order to achieve a high quality image. Most common artifacts include cross-color and cross-luminance. Not to be confused with artifact as a cultural product (Bay Area Video Coalition, 2009).</dd>

    <dt id ="audiovisual_item">Audiovisual item</dt>
    <dd>Any recorded sound or moving or still image item (Miliano & IASA, 1999).</dd>

    <dt id ="authority_control">Authority control</dt>

    <dd>An inked logo or manufacturer/brand information on the back side of a photo paper. Though there are exceptions, backprinting was a common practice for some manufacturers (Agfa, Kodak) and today provide clues about the print's origin.</dd>

    <dt id ="baking">Baking (videotape)</dt>
    <dd>The process of gently heating damaged videotape in an oven in order to enable playback. The polymer of the magnetic tape's binder deteriorates by hydrolysis, resulting in sticky shed syndrome. Archivists have reported success in baking tapes that are suffering from severe sticky shed syndrome; however, scientific research has not been conducted to explain this. The temperature and humidity of the oven must be tightly controlled, as well as the time in which a tape is baked. This process is not recommended except in extreme circumstances, as it may accelerate the deterioration of the tape. When a tape is baked successfully, it can usually be played back one time for remastering (Bay Area Video Coalition, 2009).</dd>

    <dt id ="baryta">Baryta</dt>
    <dd>A coating of barium sulfate in gelatin applied to the surface of photographic paper base to provide opacity, smoothness, and brightness. Barium sulfate is a chemically stable white pigment. Part of the weight and stiffness of a photo paper is due to the baryta undercoating, which is primarily intended to provide a smooth, pure white, inert base for the emulsion.</dd>

    <dt id ="base">Base</dt>

It gives copyright holders the ability to control the reproduction, publication, adaptation, exhibition, or performance of their works.</dd>
    <dd>NOTE: In the United States, copyright is provided for by the Constitution (Article I, Section 8) and is codified by the Copyright Act of 1976, 17 USC 101-1332. Internationally, copyright is defined by the Berne Convention, which the United States joined in 1989. Copyright protects the owner's interests in the intellectual property (content), rather than in the physical property that serves as a container for the content. For example, an archives may own a collection of papers, but the author retains copyright. As property, copyright can be transferred or inherited; hence, the owner of a work's copyright may not be the work's creator. These works may be in a wide range of media, including literary works; musical works, including any accompanying words; dramatic works, including any accompanying music; pantomimes and choreographic works; pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works; motion pictures and other audiovisual works; sound recordings; and architectural works. Copyright does not protect any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery in such works; it only protects their tangible manifestation (Pearce-Moses, 2005).</dd>

    <dd>NOTE: Materials may be deaccessioned because the repository has changed its collections policy and the material is no longer within its scope. Materials may also be deaccessioned because they have been reappraised and found to be no longer suitable for continuing preservation. Materials that are badly decomposed and beyond repair may be deaccessioned. Deaccessioned material may be offered back to its donor, offered to another institution, or destroyed. Also called permanent withdrawal (Pearce-Moses, 2005).</dd>

    <dt id ="deterioration">Deterioration (of tape)</dt>
    <dd>The degradation of tape, most typically with the binder, which is responsible for holding the magnetic particles on the tape and facilitating tape transport. If the binder loses integrity&mdash;through softening, embrittlement, loss of cohesiveness, or loss of lubrication&mdash;the tape may become unplayable. Sticky tape and sticky shed syndrome are commonly used terms to describe the phenomenon associated with the deterioration of the magnetic tape binder (Bay Area Video Coalition, 2009). </dd>

    <dt id ="developing_out_paper_">Developing-out paper (DOP)</dt>
    <dd>A photographic paper which forms a visible image through the use of a chemical developer to reveal the latent image made by exposure to light.

    <dt id ="diazo">Diazo (microform)</dt>
    <dd>A microfilm duplication process intended for service copies. Unlike silver-gelatin microfilm, diazo is not regarded as preservation quality, though it is capable of producing color. Diazonium salts in the film emulsion combine with dye couplers to produce strong, dense colors. May be on either an acetate or polyester base.</dd>

    <dt id ="digital">Digital</dt>
    <dd>Representing information through a sequence of discrete units, especially binary code.</dd>
    <dd>NOTE: "Digital" is distinguished from "analog," the latter representing information as a continuous signal. Often used as a synonym of automated, computerized, electronic, or the prefix e-. "Digital" and "electronic" are often used synonymously, although "electronic" may include analog as well as digital formats (Pearce-Moses, 2005).</dd>

    <dt id ="digital_preservation">Digital preservation</dt>
    <dd>The process of maintaining, in a condition suitable for use, materials produced in digital formats, including preservation of the bit stream and the continued ability to render or display the content represented by the bit stream. The task is compounded by the fact that some digital storage media deteriorate quickly ("bit rot"), and the digital object is inextricably entwined with its access environment (software and hardware), which is evolving in a continuous cycle of innovation and obsolescence. Also refers to the practice of digitizing materials originally produced in non-digital formats (print, film, etc.) to prevent permanent loss due to deterioration of the physical medium (Reitz, 2007).</dd>

    <dt id ="digitization">Digitization</dt>
    <dd>The process of transforming analog material into binary electronic (digital) form, especially for storage and use in a computer. The word "digitized" distinguishes materials that have been transformed from the media in which they were created from materials that are born digital. Digitization is distinguished from "data entry," which is the process of typing textual records, often in forms designed to facilitate the process, into a computer system.</dd>
    <dd>Digitization may start with information that is in electronic or physical form, for example magnetic audio tape or phonograph discs. Digitization of textual documents typically produces an image of the words, which must be transformed into character data through a process of optical character recognition (OCR). In some instances, the OCR process may preserve text and page formatting (Pearce-Moses, 2005).</dd>

    <dt id ="direct_positive">Direct positive</dt>

The fabric is typically cotton or linen, starched and calendered to create a smooth drawing surface.</dd>

    <dt id ="drafting_film">Drafting film</dt>
    <dd>Plastic drafting film was the preferred support for large-scale technical drawings from the 1980s-2000s (Lowell & Nelb, 2006). Drafting films will have a matte finish on one or both sides, which gives the surface "teeth" to accept media (pencil, ink) or emulsion. Like other translucent supports, drafting film may be used alternately for original drawings or as a reproductive intermediate. Film composition maybe either acetate or polyester (or Mylar).</dd>

    <dt id ="duplication">Duplication (process)</dt>
    <dd>In terms of reprography, duplication refers to the reproduction of virtually limitless copies from a master. This includes printing processes. Since the emergence of digital printing, the distinction between a duplicate and copy has become less clear as hardware and software utilize and blend both.</dd>

    <dt id ="dvd">DVD (abbreviation for Digital Versatile Disc)</dt>
    <dd>There are a number of different types of DVDs, which include DVD-R, DVD-ROM, DVD-RAM, DVD+RW, and DVD-RW. DVD is not a suitable archival format for video, mainly because it uses a lossy form of compression (MPEG2). It is also a format that is likely to see rapid changes in technology, which makes the risk of its obsolescence very high. DVDs are made up of a reflective aluminum layer, a polycarbonate substrate, a dye layer, and a clear lacquer layer. While the aluminum layer is highly susceptible to pollution, the lacquer layer does not sufficiently protect it from oxidizing. Double sided DVDs are bonded using an adhesive&mdash;the life expectancy of which is unknown. A DVD is the same diameter as a CD (120cm) but cannot be read by the same equipment. DVDs and CDs both encode data as tiny pits in tracks that correspond to the zeros and ones of binary digits. A laser reads and plays back the information encoded on the pits. DVDs are able to store more data than CDs by making the pits smaller, the tracks closer together, and by compressing the data using MPEG2. DVD-R discs were introduced in 1997 with a 3.95 GB capacity and a track pitch of 0.8 microns; the capacity was later increased to 4.7 GB by reducing the track pitch to 0.74 microns.</dd>
    <dd>Many artists now use DVD-R as an exhibition format, which has replaced laser disc as a popular display format for many museums and galleries. However, because of the way the data is encoded, it cannot achieve frame accurate control to reference the picture content (as it can with laser disc). Where external control is needed for display, it is important clarify any specific requirements of the control system before having the disc(s) made.</dd>
    <dd>There are two types of DVD-R discs: "General" and "Authoring." This has caused some compatibility issues, as the lasers in the discs' players need to be angled differently. Professional DVD players will have both lasers; however if you are using a domestic model, it is important to check which discs your player is compatible with. This is also true for all other types of discs. DVD is a rapidly developing technology and there is a continued push to increase the amount of data that can be stored on a disc (Bay Area Video Coalition, 2009).</dd>

    <dd>A decrease in image density resulting in overall loss of tonal value. Most photographic materials are subject to image fading due to a number of factors. Light exposure, chemical reaction between compositional elements (hurried by poor storage conditions) external chemicals or atmospheric pollutants. The destructive results of these factors may be partial or evident all over the photograph. Usually the tone of the image will be lightened and there may also be a change of color, but not a uniform color shift.</dd>

    <dd>When pure, gold is yellow, non-magnetic, and soft, making it easy to manipulate. Gold does not tarnish, however some gold alloys can tarnish. Pure gold is also resistant to corrosion. Gold and its alloys are used in jewelry, ornaments, coins, gilding/goldleaf, dental repairs, circuit boards, architecture, engineering, and medicine. The kind of metal sulphide produced in the corrosion and the extent to which the object will corrode is dependent upon how much gold is present in the mixture and what the other metal in the mixture is. Alloys are typically produced to increase gold's durability.</dd>

    <dt id ="granite">Granite</dt>

    <dt id ="streaming">Streaming (media)</dt>
    <dd>A technology for transferring data so that it can be received and processed in a steady stream (Dictonary.com, n.d.). A method of sending a sequence of compressed audio or moving images one way over a data network, at the user's request or broadcast at a fixed time, which allows listening/viewing to begin before the entire file has been transmitted. To counteract any delays caused by packet switching and to maintain the impression of continuous motion, a buffer on the client computer is used to store a few seconds of content before it is displayed on the screen. Unlike content that is downloaded for subsequent playback, streaming audio/video is stored as a temporary file and deleted when the application used to view it is closed. Videoconferencing differs from streaming video in providing two-way transmission in real time (Reitz, 2007).</dd>
