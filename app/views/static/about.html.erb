    <h1>About the PSAP</h1>
  </div>
  <p class="largest">The <strong>Preservation Self-Assessment Program (PSAP)</strong> is a free online tool that helps collection managers prioritize efforts to improve conditions of collections. Through guided evaluation of materials, storage/exhibit environments, and institutional policies, the PSAP produces reports on the factors that impact the health of cultural heritage materials, and defines the points from which to begin care. </p>

  <p class="larger">In short, the PSAP...</p>
  <ul class="larger">
    <li>Supports targeted preservation assessments of paper documents, books and bound items, photographic and image materials, audio visual material, and non-composite museum objects made of ceramic, glass, stone, or metal.</li>
    <li>Performs item- and collection-level assessments.</li>
    <li>Provides textual and image-based educational resources to aid in the identification of different types of materials and their preservation challenges (see the <%= link_to 'Collection ID Guide', collection_id_guide_path %>).</li>
    <li>Addresses factors of both storage and display, applicable from open exhibitions to closed archives.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Who is the PSAP for?</h2>
  <p>Any organization that collects paper documents, photographic and image materials, and audiovisual media, and ceramic, glass, stone, or metal objects can benefit from the PSAP, including libraries, archives, museums, and historical societies. Like the <%= link_to 'Audiovisual Self-Assessment Program (AvSAP)', 'http://www.library.illinois.edu/prescons/projects_grants/grants/avsap/' %> that preceded it, the PSAP is designed to assist staff at organizations with little to no preservation training or conservation staff.</p>

  <h2>The Focus</h2>
  <p>Our goal is to help collections managers develop a prioritized preservation plan as well as to educate them on the “health risks” posed to their collections and what they can do to mitigate them with the resources at hand. The scope of formats and materials currently covered are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Audiovisual Media</strong>: Film, Videotape (open-reel, cartridge-based; analog, digital), Audiotape (open-reel, cartridge-based; analog, digital), Phonograph Records, Optical Media (CD, DVD), Grooved Cylinders, and Wire Recordings.</li>
    <li><strong>Photographic and Image Materials</strong>: Photo Prints (B&W, color, Polaroids), Negatives (glass, film), Slides/Transparencies (glass, film), Daguerreotypes, Ambrotypes, Tintypes, Photomechanical Prints, Digital Prints, and Microform.</li>
    <li><strong>Paper (Bound, Unbound)</strong>: Various ink/media on various paper types including Documents, Books, Pamphlets, Manuscript, Typescript, Office Copies/Prints (Xeroxes, carbon copies, etc.), Architectural Drawing Reproduction (Blueprints, Photostats, etc.), and more.</li>
    <li><strong>Objects</strong>: Inorganic object materials including Ceramics, Glass, Stone, and Metal.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What is a Preservation Assessment? </h2>
  <p>Preservation assessments (and surveys) are a key element of good collection stewardship as they allow collections managers and curators to become more familiar with the condition of their collections and derive useful and accurate data about collections. These data help managers to then establish and articulate preservation needs. In general, a preservation assessment considers many different facets of preservation need, ranging from the condition of specific materials to understanding how the building, environment, policies, and use all affect the health of the materials overall. See <a href = "/manual#assessments">Preservation Assessments and Surveys</a> for more.</p>

  <h2>What do I need to get started?</h2>
  <p>The PSAP meets users on their level of experience and requires no prior knowledge about their preservation. The application guides you to answer direct questions about your resources and will provide additional help options to explain concepts and principles, and to show example images along the way. By answering questions regarding your materials, environments, and policies, you create a unique profile of your organization.</p>

  <h2>Technical Requirements</h2>
  <p>The application simply runs in your web browser. No installation is necessary. No limit is placed on the amount of items or collections you assess; all data is securely stored on University of Illinois servers. Also, for those interested, the project is open source; our code is <a href="https://github.com/PresConsUIUC/PSAP">hosted on GitHub</a>.</p>
