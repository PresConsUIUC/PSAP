      <p><strong>November 21, 2016</strong>: The PSAP has been updated to include inorganic museum objects!
        In addition to some small functional changes to the site, the PSAP
        resources and assessment tool now cover ceramic, glass, stone, and
        metal object materials.</p>
      <p>This beta version of the objects portion of the application is
        functional, but some things may change. Feedback on these additions
        and changes are welcome and can be sent to
        <a href="mailto:psap@library.illinois.edu">psap@library.illinois.edu</a>.</p>

    <p class="larger">The Preservation Self-Assessment Program (PSAP) is a
      free online tool that helps collection managers prioritize efforts to
      improve conditions of collections. Through guided evaluation of
      materials, storage/exhibit environments, and institutional policies, the
      PSAP produces reports on the factors that impact the health of cultural
      heritage materials, and defines the points from which to begin care.</p>
