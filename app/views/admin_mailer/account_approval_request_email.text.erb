A user with the following information has just created a PSAP account, but is
not yet able to sign in:

First Name: <%= @user.first_name %>
Last Name: <%= @user.last_name %>
Username: <%= @user.username %>
Email: <%= @user.email %>
About: <%= @user.about ? word_wrap(@user.about) : '' %>

1) If this user looks legitimate, please sign in to the PSAP and enable the
user at your earliest convenience. The user will not be able to sign in until
you do this. Use the URL below:

<%= @user_url %>

2) If you are not sure, please send the user an email requesting more
information.

3) If you are pretty sure that this is not a legitimate user, feel free to
sign in to PSAP and delete the user. Use the URL below:

<%= @user_url %>
