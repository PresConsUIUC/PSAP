<h1>Fasteners</h1>

<p>Items in a collection, especially unbound items, may be held together with a variety of fasteners.  Fasteners like paper clips, clamps, staples, pins, and rubber bands can be inexpensive tools for efficient storage, but they can also put items at risk for physical and chemical damage. Over time, reactive metal fasteners will oxidize and rust, permanently staining and weakening paper. Rubber bands can also oxidize, become rigid, and bond to paper. If a fastener has adhered to an item, attempting to remove it may cause irreparable damage. Do not remove fasteners that have bonded to items without consulting a professional conservator. </p>

<p>If items are held together with paper or wax seals, wafers, or adhesives, do not attempt to separate them. Some fasteners, particularly seals, ribbons, laces, and ties, may have archival or research value and their removal should be evaluated by a curator. </p>

<p>If a fastener can be removed without tearing, puncturing or otherwise damaging an item, it is recommended that it be carefully removed prior to moving the item into storage. Follow the <a href="https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/7.-conservation-procedures/7.8-removal-of-damaging-fasteners-from-historic-documents" target="_blank">NEDCC guidelines for safe fastener removal</a> to minimize the risk of physical damage to items during removal.</p>

<p>If fasteners must be used in an archival environment, stainless steel paper clips will cause the least damage to collections as long as paper is strong enough to withstand the stress of the paper clip. Paper clips should never be used on brittle paper, since the paper may break along the sharp edge of the fastener. Stainless steel paper clips can be purchased from a preservation equipment supplier.</p>
