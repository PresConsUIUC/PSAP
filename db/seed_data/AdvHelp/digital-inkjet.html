<!-- Q: Is this item viewed/handled regularly? -->

<h2 id="handlinguse">Risks of Handling/Use</h2>

<p>Generally, handling and use heightens the risk of damage to your materials, be it through neglectful handling (e.g. touching photo emulsion with bare hands) or irresponsible operation of access equipment. This is a risk posed by patrons and staff alike, intentional or not.</p>

<h3>Handling and Management</h3>
<p>Examples of neglect, mishandling, and mismanagement include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pressure-sensitive tape to mend tears;</li>
<li>Ink pens to label back of a photographic print;</li>
<li>Folding materials to fit into a given box or enclosure;</li>
<li>Poor handling: always use gloves (when handling sensitive emulsions) or wash and dry hands before handling (when handling fragile paper-based documents);</li>
<li>Inadequate packaging for shipping;</li>
<li>Lack of intellectual control over holdings, leading to harmful and excessive use of unique or vulnerable items.  Instead introduce guides/finding aids for patron use.</li>
</ul>

<p>General recommendations include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Wearing gloves (cotton, nitrile) while handling archival photographic emulsion materials; </li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t wear gloves while handling fragile documents;</li>
<li>Use only light pencils for direct labeling on a photo verso;</li>
<li>Use only PAT-compliant storage enclosure materials allowed, etc.;</li>
<li>Introduce guides/finding aids for patron use, including notes for proper handling of fragile materials;</li>
<li>Ensure that archival staff, volunteers, and patrons are adequately trained in handling collection materials;</li>
<li>Use enclosures, book carts, and other equipment as appropriate to minimize risk to materials during transport.
</li>
</ul>


<!-- Q: Are there additional copies, facsimiles, and/or access copies of this image? -->


<h2 id="copies">Additional Copies</h2>
<p> The use of additional copies for reference or display purposes is highly recommended, particularly if the item is an original or valuable. This provides broader access to the content while also protecting the original document from user wear and tear or environmental factors.</p>

<p>Recommendations for care of original object:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ideally, originals should be used once to produce an access copy, facsimile, or surrogate;</li> 
<li>Copies would then be put to use by the institution in place of the original, sustaining the wear and tear of patron use or prolonged exhibition;</li> 
<li>These measures save the original from the wear and tear of use;</li>
</ul>

<!-- Q: Is this item properly supported in storage? -->

<h2 id="orientation">Orientation in Storage</h2>

<p>Never stack inkjet prints in indefinite storage. Store vertically with dividers between each print. May also be stored horizontally (flat), especially large format prints. Avoid folding or rolling prints. Enclosures and folders may be stored in hanging files or archival storage boxes.</p>



<!-- Q: Does this item have an appropriate container in good condition? -->

<h2 id="container">Storage Container</h2>

<p>Acid-free (pH 7.29.5) enclosures and/or folders strongly advised. Each print should have its own enclosure to protect it from ink bleeds, dust, handling damage, and environmental shifting. This enclosure may be a paper (conservation-quality, acid-free) or plastic (uncoated polyester, polyethylene, polypropylene, cellulose triacetate) sleeve, envelope, or wrapper. vPosition image side away from seams in paper enclosures. Such seams should be on the sides of the enclosure, not down its center.</p>

<p>Enclosures should be stored in hanging file folders or archival storage boxes. Avoid wood cabinets. Enameled steel, stainless steel, or anodized aluminum are preferred. All storage materials should pass the Photographic Activity Test (PAT) as specified in ISO Standard 18916:2007.</p>

<!-- Q: Does the container or item have any meaningful labeling? -->

<h2 id="storage-label">Labeling</h2>

<p><em>If your item has any kind of labeling on the container, the item itself, or any related material we highly recommend that you return to the Basic Info section and enter this information in the appropriate field(s).</em></p>

<p>Labeling on a container or on the item itself, if it is in fact correct, can offer important clues about its content. If you are replacing a container that holds labeling information, it is important to transfer this information to the new container or label. Be sure to copy down any titles, dates or other data found on these items&mdash;and save notes. Container labels should be used with caution as they are frequently reused or easily switched by accident.</p>

<p>For sleeves and folders especially remember that it's generally best to label with a no. 2 pencil. If ink must be used (i.e. on a plastic enclosure), use an archival pigment-ink pen (e.g. Micron).</p>

<!-- Q: What is the state of the image, in terms of physical damage sustained? -->

<h2 id="damage">Physical Damage</h2>

<p>Regardless of its acidity and inherent vice, all paper is susceptible to tearing and other forms of mechanical damage.</p>

<p>When assessing damage to a printed image, check for water exposure&mdash;black inks are usually oil-based and therefore water insoluble, but color inks are often water soluble and should be protected from exposure to moisture that might distort the image.</p>

<!-- Q: Is this item exhibiting mold and/or pest (insect, rodent) damage?  -->

<h2 id="moldpest">Mold / Pest Damage</h2>

<p>Pests like insects and rodents tend to like paper and textile materials. High humidity (higher than 68% RH) promotes mold growth and insect infestation, both of which can cause permanent damage. When assessing the exposure of your collections to pests, it is necessary to look not just at the materials themselves and their containers&mdash;it is also important to look around at the larger environment. Insects and rodents tend to leave droppings in areas they inhabit. Insects tend to leave behind a substance called frass, which is the undigested fibers from paper. If you see droppings and/or frass in the storage area it is a strong sign that your materials are being exposed to pests. Small, irregular holes on paper-based enclosures are also a sign that pests have attacked your materials.</p>

<p>Some tips for reducing your materials' exposure to pests are to refrain from eating anywhere near your collections materials. Crumbs and food waste draw pests, so eat far from your collections. Another tip applying to both pests and mold is to be cautious about donated materials when you receive them. Pests and mold can hitch a ride into your facility on these materials, so having a good, clean staging area where you can inspect donated items for, among other things, pest and mold evidence can help you reduce your storage environments' exposure to both.</p>

<!-- Q: Is the paper yellowed and/or brittle? This will be most evident along the edges or back side -->

<h2 id="decay-paper">Paper Decay</h2>

<p>Paper is sensitive to light and water exposure, high humidity, and high heat. Exposure to light and/or heat will accelerate deterioration in the form of yellowing and sometimes embrittlement.</p>

<p>Acidic paper (pH below 7.0) commonly exhibits both deteriorative traits. Colored media on the paper support will fade rapidly. Water exposure can ultimately lead to desiccated or brittle paper, therefore more easily torn or damaged through handling. Fluctuating temperature and RH may result in warping, cockling of the paper surface. High humidity (higher than 68% RH) promotes mold growth and insect infestation, both of which can cause permanent damage.</p>

<p>According to a study by the Library of Congress, even pH neutral papers will become increasingly acidic over time. This is due to the fact that cellulose naturally generates acids as it ages. Papers, including book leaves, that are darker and more brittle along their edges than center demonstrate an absorption of airborne pollutants that have formed acids.</p>

<p>Soil and dust may become ground into paper fibers, permanently soiling or staining the paper surface. Foxing is a common form of paper deterioration which manifests as reddish-brown spots or blotches which appear embedded in the paper surface. Foxing is caused by a number of factors, but is commonly spurred along by high humidity.</p>

<!-- Q: Is this uncoated or coated paper? -->

<h2 id="coated">Coated and Uncoated Paper</h2>

<p> Paper may be uncoated or resin-coated (RC).  A pigment-based ink on coated (glossy) paper will exhibit a differential surface gloss between areas of high and low ink density, especially when viewed under direct light. </p>

<h3 id="uncoatedinkjet">Uncoated paper</h3>

<p>Uncoated paper is typically used for printing documents, and does not yield high-quality image reproductions.  The amount of ink used to print images usually causes the paper to cockle.  Since the ink is absorbed directly by the paper, images are not vibrant or sharp.  Some uncoated papers, marketed especially for inkjet printers, are treated to address these problems; however print quality is still lower than prints made with swellable or porous paper.  Images printed on uncoated paper are likely the result of a consumer-grade inkjet printer and were probably printed in a home or office.  Commercially produced prints are typically made on coated papers.</p>

<h3 id="swellableinkjet">Swellable coated paper</h3>

<p>Swellable paper is comprised of resin-coated paper with an image-receiving layer.  The image-receiving layer swells to absorb the liquid ink as it is sprayed during the printing process.  This results in a vibrant, crisp image that sits in a layer on top of the paper rather than absorbing into it.  Only dye-based inks are used to print on swellable paper, since pigment inks cannot absorb into the image-receiving layer.  Swellable paper typically has a glossy finish which mimics traditional photo paper prints.  Images printed on coated swellable paper may be produced professionally or at home.  Swellable papers have decreased in popularity due to the fact that prints take some time to dry completely (sometimes up to 24 hours), as opposed to porous papers which dry instantly.</p>

<h3 id="porousinkjet">Porous coated paper</h3>

<p>Porous paper is comprised of paper, with optional resin-coating, with a surface layer of mineral particles attached to the paper by a polymer binder.  These mineral particles create tiny pores on the surface of the paper which absorb ink and dry instantly.  Porous paper typically is not as glossy as swellable paper, and is manufactured with and without the RC layer.  Porous paper without RC layers may be classified as "fine art paper" and is used to produce fine art prints, or giclée prints (not all fine art inkjet papers are porous papers, however).  Images printed on porous paper may be produced professionally or at home.  Inkjet prints on porous paper are more susceptible to abrasion than prints on swellable paper.</p>
<!-- Q: Does it appear to be a "porous" or "swellable" paper type? -->

<h2 id="porous">Porous or Swellable Paper</h2>
<p>Inkjet papers are varied and complex. The types of paper described here are a general guide. Manufacturers typically do not indicate whether a paper is porous or swellable, but there are a few characteristics that can aid in identification. If a paper is labelled "instant dry" it is porous. Swellable papers may be labeled as "fast drying." Swellable papers may also be labeled as "high gloss" rather than just "glossy." Many inkjet printing papers have a manufacturer stamp on the back indicating the product name or brand; this also may be used to identify the paper type.</p>

<!-- Q: Assess the degree of image fading, discoloration, and/or staining -->

<h2 id="fadingstaining">Fading, Staining, and Discoloration</h2>
<p> Inkjet prints are prone to yellowing and staining, especially if exposed to high humidity, intense light, or atmospheric pollutants such as ozone. Ink bleeding, streaking, and distortion may occur if exposed to moisture. Pigment-based inks are considerably more stable than dye-based, but may also be water-basedand thusly sensitive to moisture.</p>

<p>If you are aware of airbourne pollutants in the space that your material is housed, be certain to check for discoloration and silver mirroring. airbourne pollutants initiate chemical reactions that may stain and degrade support/base materials, accelerate the fading, staining, or loss of photographic, print/writing media.</p>
