<!-- Q: Is this item viewed/handled regularly? -->

<h2 id="handlinguse">Risks of Handling/Use</h2>

<p>Generally, handling and use heightens the risk of damage to your materials, be it through neglectful handling (e.g. touching photo emulsion with bare hands) or irresponsible operation of access equipment. This is a risk posed by patrons and staff alike, intentional or not.</p>

<h3>Handling and Management</h3>
<p>Examples of neglect, mishandling, and mismanagement include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pressure-sensitive tape to mend tears;</li>
<li>Ink pens to label back of a photographic print;</li>
<li>Folding materials to fit into a given box or enclosure;</li>
<li>Poor handling: always use gloves (when handling sensitive emulsions) or wash and dry hands before handling (when handling fragile paper-based documents);</li>
<li>Inadequate packaging for shipping;</li>
<li>Lack of intellectual control over holdings, leading to harmful and excessive use of unique or vulnerable items.  Instead introduce guides/finding aids for patron use.</li>
</ul>

<p>General recommendations include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Wearing gloves (cotton, nitrile) while handling archival photographic emulsion materials; </li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t wear gloves while handling fragile documents;</li>
<li>Use only light pencils for direct labeling on a photo verso;</li>
<li>Use only PAT-compliant storage enclosure materials allowed, etc.;</li>
<li>Introduce guides/finding aids for patron use, including notes for proper handling of fragile materials;</li>
<li>Ensure that archival staff, volunteers, and patrons are adequately trained in handling collection materials;</li>
<li>Use enclosures, book carts, and other equipment as appropriate to minimize risk to materials during transport.
</li>
</ul>


<!-- Q: Are there additional copies, facsimiles, and/or access copies of this image? -->


<h2 id="copies">Additional Copies</h2>
<p> The use of additional copies for reference or display purposes is highly recommended, particularly if the item is an original or valuable. This provides broader access to the content while also protecting the original document from user wear and tear or environmental factors.</p>

<p>Recommendations for care of original object:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ideally, originals should be used once to produce an access copy, facsimile, or surrogate;</li> 
<li>Copies would then be put to use by the institution in place of the original, sustaining the wear and tear of patron use or prolonged exhibition;</li> 
<li>These measures save the original from the wear and tear of use;</li>
</ul>

<!-- SECTION: Storage | Container -->

<!-- Q: Is this item properly supported in storage? -->

<h2 id="orientation">Orientation in Storage</h2>

<p>Store vertically with dividers between each print. May also be stored horizontally, especially large prints. Enclosures and folders may be stored in hanging files or archival storage boxes.</p>


<!-- Q: Does this item have an appropriate container in good condition? -->

<h2 id="container">Storage Container</h2>

<p>Store instant prints/films away from other photographs due to the escape of chemicals and sharp, sturdy corners with an ability to damage adjacent photos. Store integral instant prints on their sides rather than on end so to prevent dye migration. Acidic and high-alkaline enclosures and/or folders should be avoided. Materials with a pH of 7.0 to 8.5 are recommended. Each print should have its own enclosure to protect it from dust, handling damage, and changes in environmental conditions. This enclosure may be a paper (archival quality) or plastic (uncoated polyester, polyethylene, polypropylene, cellulose triacetate) sleeve, envelope, or wrapper. Paper enclosure seams should be along the sides, not down its center. Enclosures and folders may be stored in hanging files or archival storage boxes. Wood cabinets should be avoided. Enameled steel, stainless steel, or anodized aluminum are preferred. All storage materials should pass the Photographic Activity Test (PAT) as specified in ISO Standard 18916:2007.</p>



<!-- Q: Does the container or item have any meaningful labeling? -->

<h2 id="storage-label">Labeling</h2>

<p><em>If your item has any kind of labeling on the container, the item itself, or any related material we highly recommend that you return to the Basic Info section and enter this information in the appropriate field(s).</em></p>

<p>Labeling on a container or on the item itself, if it is in fact correct, can offer important clues about its content. If you are replacing a container that holds labeling information, it is important to transfer this information to the new container or label. Be sure to copy down any titles, dates or other data found on these items&mdash;and save notes. Container labels should be used with caution as they are frequently reused or easily switched by accident.</p>

<p>For sleeves and folders especially remember that it's generally best to label with a no. 2 pencil. If ink must be used (i.e. on a plastic enclosure), use an archival pigment-ink pen (e.g. Micron).</p>

<!-- Q: What is the state of the image, in terms of physical damage sustained? -->

<h2 id="damage">Physical Damage</h2>

<p>Regardless of its acidity and inherent vice, all paper is susceptible to tearing and other forms of mechanical damage. Fiber-based prints will have a tendency to curl, usually as a result of fluctuating humidity.</p>

<p>Care must always be shown when handling prints to avoid abrasion, scratching, and surface wear. Do not attempt to clean print surface. The white border found around instant photos should never be cut off or removed; it provides a barrier to atmospheric pollutants and removal would also weaken the structural integrity of the photograph. Unmounted prints may curl. A stable environment should also prevent the emulsion from delaminating.</p>

<!-- Q: Is this item exhibiting mold and/or pest (insect, rodent) damage?  -->

<h2 id="moldpest">Mold / Pest Damage</h2>

<p>The gelatin binder of a photographic emulsion is an especially good nutrient for mold. If your item is exhibiting white or brown patches or you see a lattice-like growth along the edges, you are most likely viewing mold. Negatives stored in hot, humid environments (generally above 65% relative humidity) is most vulnerable to mold, mildew and fungus contamination. Mold will typically damage the edges of a photographic material first. If mold has eaten into the emulsion, the item will be noticeably and irreparably damaged, exhibiting feathery-like distortions or dull spots on the projected image. Mold can be removed through cleaning and then storing the items in a cold, dry environment (NFPF, 2004), but this should be done responsibly (see Bibliography for more info). </p>

<p>Pests like insects and rodents tend to like paper and textile materials. High humidity (higher than 68% RH) promotes mold growth and insect infestation, both of which can cause permanent damage. When assessing the exposure of your collections to pests, it is necessary to look not just at the materials themselves and their containers&mdash;it is also important to look around at the larger environment. Insects and rodents tend to leave droppings in areas they inhabit. Insects tend to leave behind a substance called frass, which is the undigested fibers from paper. If you see droppings and/or frass in the storage area it is a strong sign that your materials are being exposed to pests. Small, irregular holes on paper-based enclosures are also a sign that pests have attacked your materials.</p>

<p>Some tips for reducing your materials' exposure to pests are to refrain from eating anywhere near your collections materials. Crumbs and food waste draw pests, so eat far from your collections. Another tip applying to both pests and mold is to be cautious about donated materials when you receive them. Pests and mold can hitch a ride into your facility on these materials, so having a good, clean staging area where you can inspect donated items for, among other things, pest and mold evidence can help you reduce your storage environments' exposure to both.</p>

<!-- Q: Is this a peel-apart or integral (e.g. type 600) instant photo? -->

<h2 id="instant-films">Instant Films</h2>
<h3>Peel-apart</h3>

<p>B&W instant photos are generally of the peel-apart variety; B&W integral photos do exist (Polaroid type 600), but are rare.</p>

<p>All peel-apart prints have some tendency to curl in toward the image. Occasionally there will be noticeable defects at the image's edge from an uneven spread of developer between the negative and receiving layers during processing. The peel-apart print is generally more stable than its integral counterpart. However, for prints requiring hand-coating (all B&W before 1970), prior to application, the image is extremely susceptible to damage. Once coated, the image is rather stable. If coated improperly, localized fading of the image, brownish-yellow streaking and fading may occur. Overall yellowing is also common, particularly in color photo image highlights and border.</p>

<p><strong>Coated peel-apart prints</strong> are exclusively B&W. Initially known as the Polaroid Land process, this peel-apart print requires a protective coating/stabilizer after processing. The image is pulled apart from the negative film and is subsequently hand-coated. Until 1970, all Polaroid B&W films required this protective polymer coater.</p>

<h3>Integral</h3>

<p>Integral prints may be color or black and white. Negative and positive comprise one unit containing all processing chemicals and layers were embedded. Polaroid's SX-70 integral color format contained as many as thirteen interdependent layers.</p> 

<p>Developing chemical pods are located adjacent to the image, accounting for the characteristic unproportional white border. Evident "Polaroid", "SX-70", or other film type backprint often appears after 1968. For the less common Kodak formats produced from 1976 to 1985, "Kodak'" and "PR10" backprints may be present.</p>

<p>Integral will fade significantly faster than peel-apart prints (Wilhelm & Brower, 1993). Instant color on the whole will fade noticeably upon exposure to intense light levels.</p>
<!-- Q: Does the image appear to be distorted or cracking?-->

<h2 id="cracking">Cracking and Distortion</h2>

<p> In an instant photo process, all the chemicals necessary to create the print are self-contained within or facing the support material and are activated when the exposure is made and the image is squeezed through rollers ejecting it from the camera. Because instant photo processes do not incorporate liquid baths to remove the silver compund, instant prints are highly succeptible to distortion if the silver image migrates, usually as a result of poor storage orientation.</p>

<p> Instant photos are also succeptible to cracking and crazing as a result of fluctuating humidity.  Instant photos manufactured before 1976 may also exhibit cracking in the image receiving layer (beneath the transparent print cover sheet) (Pénichon, 2013).</p>

<!-- Q: Is the support (card mount or paper) discolored and/or brittle? This will be most evident along the edges -->

<h2 id="decay-paper">Paper Decay</h2>

<p>Paper is sensitive to light and water exposure, high humidity, and high heat. Exposure to light and/or heat will accelerate deterioration in the form of yellowing and sometimes embrittlement.</p>

<p>Acidic paper (pH below 7.0) commonly exhibits both deteriorative traits. Colored media on the paper support will fade rapidly. Water exposure can ultimately lead to desiccated or brittle paper, therefore more easily torn or damaged through handling. Fluctuating temperature and RH may result in warping, cockling of the paper surface. High humidity (higher than 68% RH) promotes mold growth and insect infestation, both of which can cause permanent damage.</p>

<p>According to a study by the Library of Congress, even pH neutral papers will become increasingly acidic over time. This is due to the fact that cellulose naturally generates acids as it ages. Papers, including book leaves, that are darker and more brittle along their edges than center demonstrate an absorption of airborne pollutants that have formed acids.</p>

<p>Soil and dust may become ground into paper fibers, permanently soiling or staining the paper surface. Foxing is a common form of paper deterioration which manifests as reddish-brown spots or blotches which appear embedded in the paper surface. Foxing is caused by a number of factors, but is commonly spurred along by high humidity.</p>


<!-- Q: Assess the degree of image fading, discoloration, and/or staining -->

<h2 id="fadingstaining">Fading, Staining, and Discoloration</h2>

<p> Generally, B&W instant photos commonly fade around the edges and develop discolored patches throughout the print. Properly coated peel-apart prints are resistant to abrasion, but more susceptible to chemical contaminants. B&W photos manufactured by Polaroid before 1970 required the print to be hand-coated with a protective polymer. If applied unevenly, uncoated areas may develop yellowing, loss of detail, and increased sensitivity to abrasion.</p>
