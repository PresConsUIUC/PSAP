<h1>Understanding Dates</h1>
<p>Assigning dates to resources can be a tricky process, because it is often difficult to determine whether the date value should be the date the resource was created, the creation date of the items the resource contains (if it is a collection of items), the date of the original resource (if it is a digital version or facsimile), or the copyright date (usually in the case of a book). For the purposes of the PSAP, date values should represent the creation of the physical resources. This is important in determining the preservation risks to the physical material.</p>

<p>If you are interested in finding out more about describing archives resources, see the Society of American Archivists' <a href="http://www2.archivists.org/standards/DACS" target="_blank">Describing Archives: A Content Standard (DACS)</a>.

<h2>Entering Dates</h2>

<p>The date value follows the YYYY-MM-DD syntax, and comes in three different forms (types):</p>

<p><strong>Single date</strong>: Resource falls within a single year or has an exact date (e.g. "1987" or "1987-02-27")</p>

<p><strong>Span/Inclusive range</strong>: Resource spans across a range of dates: the earliest and latest dates (e.g. Begin: "1987"; End: "2014")</p>

<p><strong>Bulk range</strong>: Resource has a predominant focus in this date range; may be used to complement a span/inclusive date range (e.g. Begin: "1987"; End: "2014")</p>

<p>If the full date is unknown, month and year (YYYY-MM) or just year (YYYY) may be used.</p>

<h2>Use Cases:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>My resource is a single, hand-colored, <a href="http://psap.library.illinois.edu/format-id-guide/photoprint#silvergelprint" target="_blank">silver gelatin print</a>. This is one of several prints produced from a negative. The polyester negative was produced in 1957, but the print being assessed was produced in 1981. 
		<ul>
		<li>
		During assessment, the date assigned to this resource should be a <strong>single date</strong> of 1981, because that is the date that represents the material components of the print.
		</li>
		</ul> 
	</li><br>
	<li>My resource is a <a href="http://psap.library.illinois.edu/format-id-guide/opticalmedia#cd" target="_blank">compact disc</a> created in 2010 containing files originally created in 1985. 
		<ul>
		<li>
		For the purposes of the PSAP assessment, the date assigned to this resource should be a <strong>single date</strong> of 2010 because that is the creation date of the physical item. The PSAP is not designed to comprehensively address digital content, and while issues like file format obsolescence may affect the resource, that is outside the scope of the PSAP assessment.
		</li>
		</ul>
	</li><br>
	<li>My resource is a collection of documents accessioned after the retirement of a faculty member, created throughout her tenure at my institution, from 1975-2005. However, the vase majority of the documents were created between 1999 and 2001. 
		<ul>
		<li>
		In this instance, the resource should be assigned a <strong>span/inclusive range</strong> of Begin: "1987"; End: "2014". Additionally, it could be assigned a <strong>bulk range</strong> of Begin: "1999"; End: "2001".
		</li>
		</ul>
	</li><br>
	<li>My resource is printed ephemera, and I have no idea what the date of creation is. 
		<ul>
		<li>
		In this case, try using the <a href="https://psap.library.illinois.edu/format-id-guide" target="_blank">Format ID Guide</a> to determine the general time frame that the resource could have been produced. If no date can be determined, you may leave the date field blank and continue to assess the recource without it.
