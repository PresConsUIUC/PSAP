<h2 id="handlinguse">Risks of Handling/Use</h2>


<p>Generally, handling and use heightens the risk of damage to your materials, be it through neglectful handling (e.g. touching photo emulsion with bare hands) or irresponsible operation of access equipment. This is a risk posed by patrons and staff alike, intentional or not.</p>

<h3>Handling and Management</h3>
<p>Examples of neglect, mishandling, and mismanagement include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pressure-sensitive tape to mend tears;</li>
<li>Permanent or volatile inks used to label documents (even the back side);</li>
<li>Folding materials to fit into a given box or enclosure;</li>
<li>Poor handling: not using gloves when handling sensitive emulsions or not washing/drying hands before handling fragile paper-based documents;</li>
<li>Inadequate packaging for shipping;</li>
<li>Lack of intellectual control over holdings, leading to harmful and excessive use of unique or vulnerable items;</li>  
<li>Lack of guides and finding aids for patron use.</li>
</ul>

<p>General recommendations include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Wear gloves (cotton, nitrile) while handling archival photographic emulsion materials; </li>
<li>Avoid wearing gloves while handling fragile items, since gloves can hamper tactile senses and lead to mechanical damage;</li>
<li>Use only light pencils for direct labeling on a photo verso;</li>
<li>Use only PAT-compliant storage enclosure materials allowed, etc.;</li>
<li>Introduce guides and finding aids for patron use, including notes on the proper handling of fragile materials;</li>
<li>Ensure that archival staff, volunteers, and patrons are adequately trained in handling collection materials;</li>
<li>Use both hands and ask for assistance when handling/moving oversized materials;</li>
<li>Use enclosures, book carts, and other equipment as appropriate to minimize risk to materials during transport.</li>
</ul>

<!-- Q: Are there additional copies, facsimiles, and/or access copies of this image? -->


<h2 id="copies">Additional Copies</h2>
<p> The use of additional copies for reference or display purposes is highly recommended, particularly if the item is an original or valuable. This provides broader access to the content while also protecting the original document from user wear and tear or environmental factors.</p>

<p>Recommendations for care of original object:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ideally, originals should be used once to produce an access copy, facsimile, or surrogate;</li> 
<li>Copies would then be put to use by the institution in place of the original, sustaining the wear and tear of patron use or prolonged exhibition;</li> 

</ul>

<!-- SECTION: Storage | Container -->

<!-- Q: Is this item properly supported in storage? -->

<h2 id="orientation">Orientation in Storage</h2>

<p>Store vertically in file folders.  Place vertically inside acid free storage boxes or steel filing cabinets. </p>

<!-- Q: Does this item have an appropriate container in good condition? -->

<h2 id="container">Storage Container</h2>

<p>Loose, unbound records should be stored in acid-free file folders. Folders should be placed in acid-free or low-lignin archival boxes. Alkaline storage enclosures are not advised for typographic copies, which may contain aniline dyes. Alternatively, folders may be stored in steel filing cabinets with a baked enamel finish. Care must be taken not to overfill folders and boxes. Documents should fit easily in folders and boxes, and they should not be forced into enclosures that are too small. Spacer boards (created using scored and folded acid-free board) may be placed in underfilled boxes to prevent folders from slumping or bending.</p>

<p>Responsible display practices ensure the long-term preservation of collections. Facsimiles should be used whenever possible. Paper artifacts should not be displayed permanently. Light levels in the exhibition area should be kept low. Appropriate filters should be used to minimize exposure to ultraviolet light. Display cases should be enclosed and sealed to protect their contents, and their items should be securely framed or matted using preservation-quality materials that have passed the Photographic Activity Test (ISO 18916:2007).</p>


<!-- Q: Does the container or item have any meaningful labeling? -->

<h2 id="storage-label">Labeling</h2>

<p><em>If your item has any kind of labeling on the container, the item itself, or any related material, we highly recommend that you return to the Basic Info section and enter this information in the appropriate field(s).</em></p>

<p>Labeling on a container or on the item itself, if it is in fact correct, can offer important clues about its content. If you are replacing a container that holds labeling information, it is important to transfer this information to the new container or label. Be sure to copy down any titles, dates, or other data found on these items; and, save your notes. Container labels should be used with caution as they are frequently reused or easily switched by accident.</p>

<p>For sleeves and folders especially, remember that it's generally best to label with a no. 2 pencil. If ink must be used (i.e. on a plastic enclosure), use an archival pigment-ink pen (e.g. Micron).</p>

<!-- SECTION: Condition -->

<!-- Q: What is the state of the image, in terms of physical damage sustained? -->

<h2 id="damage">Physical Damage</h2>

<p>Regardless of its acidity and inherent vice, all paper is susceptible to tearing and other forms of mechanical damage. Water exposure can affect the structural integrity of paper, leading to desiccated or brittle paper, which is more easily torn and damaged through handling. If paper has been folded, creased areas will be especially vulnerable to tearing. </p>

<p>Unbound paper may be damaged by fasteners like paper clips, and it is especially at risk during removal of fasteners. Metal fasteners that are not stainless steel will eventually corrode, and plastic fasteners may cause warping. For information on the correct removal of fasteners, consult the NEDCC leaflet on the <a href="https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/7.-conservation-procedures/7.8-removal-of-damaging-fasteners-from-historic-documents" target="_blank">Removal of Damaging Fasteners from Historic Documents</a>. </p>

<!-- Q: To what degree is this damage affecting visual information (image, text)?  -->

<h2 id="visualinfo">Impact of Damage on Visual Information</h2>

<p>When evaluating the impact of damage on visual information, look for mechanical damage as well as deterioration and decay that obscures or limits access to information. This could include yellowing and embrittlement, both types of damage especially symptomatic of newsprint and other wood pulp papers. Damage could also include fading, darkening, warping or cockling, blocking (especially of coated papers), tearing, mold, and insect infestation.</p>

<!-- Q: Is this item exhibiting mold and/or pest (insect, rodent) damage?  -->

<h2 id="moldpest">Mold / Pest Damage</h2>

<p>Pests like insects and rodents tend to like paper and textile materials. High humidity (higher than 68% RH) promotes mold growth and insect infestation, both of which can cause permanent damage. When assessing the exposure of your collections to pests, it is necessary to look not just at the materials themselves and their containers, but also to look at the larger environment. Insects and rodents tend to leave droppings in areas they inhabit. Insects tend to leave behind a substance called frass, which is the undigested fibers from paper. If you see droppings and/or frass in the storage area, it is a strong sign that your materials are being exposed to pests. Small, irregular holes on paper-based enclosures are also a sign that pests have attacked your materials.</p>

<p>Some tips for reducing your materials' exposure to pests are to refrain from eating anywhere near your collections materials. Crumbs draw pests, so keep food far away from your collections. Another tip applying to both pests and mold is to be cautious about donated materials when you receive them. Pests and mold can hitch a ride into your facility on these materials, so having a good, clean staging area where you can inspect donated items for, among other things, pest and mold evidence can help you reduce your storage environments' exposure to both.</p>

<!-- Q: Is the paper discolored and/or brittle? -->

<h2 id="decay-paper">Paper Decay</h2>

<p>An inkjet print is comprised of a paper support and a pigment- or dye-based ink. Paper may be uncoated or resin-coated (RC). Inkjet papers are varied and complex. </p>

<h3 id="uncoatedinkjet">Uncoated paper</h3>

<p>Uncoated paper is typically used for printing documents, and it does not yield high-quality image reproductions.  The amount of ink used to print images usually causes the paper to cockle.  Since the ink is absorbed directly by the paper, images are not vibrant or sharp.  Some uncoated papers, marketed especially for inkjet printers, are treated to address these problems; however, print quality is still lower than prints made with swellable or porous paper.  Images printed on uncoated paper are likely the result of a consumer-grade inkjet printer, and they were probably printed in a home or office.  Commercially produced prints are typically made on coated papers.</p>

<h3 id="swellableinkjet">Swellable coated paper</h3>

<p>Swellable paper is comprised of resin-coated paper with an image-receiving layer.  The image-receiving layer swells to absorb the liquid ink as it is sprayed during the printing process.  This results in a vibrant, crisp image that sits in a layer on top of the paper rather than absorbing into it.  Only dye-based inks are used to print on swellable paper, since pigment inks cannot absorb into the image-receiving layer.  Swellable paper typically has a glossy finish that mimics traditional photo paper prints.  Images printed on coated swellable paper may be produced professionally or at home.  Swellable papers have decreased in popularity, due to the fact that prints take some time to dry completely (sometimes up to 24 hours) as opposed to porous papers which dry instantly.</p>

<h3 id="porousinkjet">Porous coated paper</h3>

<p>Porous paper is comprised of paper, with optional resin-coating, with a surface layer of mineral particles attached to the paper by a polymer binder.  These mineral particles create tiny pores on the surface of the paper that absorb ink and dry instantly.  Porous paper typically is not as glossy as swellable paper, and it is manufactured with and without the resin-coated layer.  While not all fine art inkjet papers are porous papers, porous paper without resin-coated layers may be classified as "fine art paper" and can be used to produce fine art, or giclée, prints.  Images printed on porous paper may be produced professionally or at home.  Inkjet prints on porous paper are more susceptible to abrasion than prints on swellable paper.</p>

<p>Acidic paper (pH below 7.0) commonly exhibits both deteriorative traits. Colored media on the paper support will fade rapidly. Water exposure can ultimately lead to desiccated or brittle paper, making it more easily torn or damaged through handling. Fluctuating temperature and RH may result in warping or cockling of the paper surface. High humidity (higher than 68% RH) promotes mold growth and insect infestation, both of which can cause permanent damage.</p>

<p>Even pH neutral papers will become increasingly acidic over time. This is due to the fact that cellulose naturally generates acids as it ages. Papers, including book leaves, that are darker and more brittle along their edges than center demonstrate an absorption of airborne pollutants that have formed acids.</p>

<p>Soil and dust may become ground into paper fibers, permanently soiling or staining the paper surface. Foxing is a common form of paper deterioration, which manifests as reddish-brown spots or blotches that appear embedded in the paper surface. Foxing is caused by a number of factors, but it is commonly spurred along by high humidity.</p>


<!-- Q: What proportion of the ink/media is "at risk"? -->

<h2 id="inkmediarisk">Ink/Media Deterioration</h2>

<p>Inkjet prints may be made with a variety of CMYK dyes and pigments, often dependent on the type of paper used. Preservation risks are highly variable, depending on ink and paper type, colorants (dye or pigment), receiving layer, and even original printer settings. Inkjet prints are prone to yellowing and staining, especially if exposed to high humidity, intense light, or atmospheric pollutants like ozone. Ink bleeding, streaking, and distortion may occur if exposed to moisture. Pigment-based inks are considerably more stable than dye-based, but they may also be water-based and thus sensitive to moisture.</p>

<h3 id="dyeinkjet">Dye-based ink</h3>

<p>Dye-based inks are cheaper and are therefore more widely used than pigment-based inks in both home and office settings.  Dye inks, however, are prone to a number of preservation issues.  Dye inks are very sensitive to moisture.  They will spread and run if even a single drop of water is introduced to the print surface.</p>

<h3 id="pigmentinkjet">Pigment-based ink</h3>

<p>Pigment inks resist water quite well and are less likely to run or smear due to moisture.  Pigment inks are also more lightfast than dye-based inks, and, if printed on a good-quality paper, they may last more than 100 years before any fading occurs.  The main preservation concern with pigment ink prints is that pigment inks are more prone to abrasion, especially in areas of dense, dark color.  Pigment inks may also be identified by a differential surface gloss between areas of high ink density and areas where no ink is present.</p>

<p>Characteristics of ink and other media vary depending on their composition and method of formulation. As such, the stability of media has a long-term effect on its paper support, and vice versa. It should be assumed that all media has potential to fade under extreme light exposure and that ink will bleed or transfer if exposed to moisture.</p>
