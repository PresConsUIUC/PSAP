<!-- Q: Is this item viewed/handled regularly? -->

<h2 id="handlinguse">Risks of Handling/Use</h2>

<p>Generally, handling and use heightens the risk of damage to your materials, be it through neglectful handling (e.g. touching photo emulsion with bare hands) or irresponsible operation of access equipment. This is a risk posed by patrons and staff alike, intentional or not.</p>

<h3>Handling and Management</h3>
<p>Examples of neglect, mishandling, and mismanagement include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pressure-sensitive tape to mend tears;</li>
<li>Ink pens to label back of a photographic print;</li>
<li>Folding materials to fit into a given box or enclosure;</li>
<li>Poor handling: always use gloves (when handling sensitive emulsions) or wash and dry hands before handling (when handling fragile paper-based documents);</li>
<li>Inadequate packaging for shipping;</li>
<li>Lack of intellectual control over holdings, leading to harmful and excessive use of unique or vulnerable items.  Instead introduce guides/finding aids for patron use.</li>
</ul>

<p>General recommendations include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Wearing gloves (cotton, nitrile) while handling archival photographic emulsion materials; </li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t wear gloves while handling fragile documents;</li>
<li>Use only light pencils for direct labeling on a photo verso;</li>
<li>Use only PAT-compliant storage enclosure materials allowed, etc.;</li>
<li>Introduce guides/finding aids for patron use, including notes for proper handling of fragile materials;</li>
<li>Ensure that archival staff, volunteers, and patrons are adequately trained in handling collection materials;</li>
<li>Use enclosures, book carts, and other equipment as appropriate to minimize risk to materials during transport.
</li>
</ul>


<!-- Q: Are there additional copies, facsimiles, and/or access copies of this image? -->


<h2 id="copies">Additional Copies</h2>
<p> The use of additional copies for reference or display purposes is highly recommended, particularly if the item is an original or valuable. This provides broader access to the content while also protecting the original document from user wear and tear or environmental factors.</p>

<p>Recommendations for care of original object:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ideally, originals should be used once to produce an access copy, facsimile, or surrogate;</li> 
<li>Copies would then be put to use by the institution in place of the original, sustaining the wear and tear of patron use or prolonged exhibition;</li> 
<li>These measures save the original from the wear and tear of use;</li>
</ul>

<!-- SECTION: Storage | Container -->

<!-- Q: Is this item properly supported in storage? -->

<h2 id="orientation">Orientation in Storage</h2>

<p>Books should be stored upright on the tail edge. They should be gently supported, not tightly crammed onto shelves, and not allowed to slump or sit at an angle. If a book is too tall to fit on the shelf, it should be stored upright on the spine or flat horizontally. A book should never be stored on its fore edge; the weight of the textblock is pulled away from the spine and may cause the hinges to loosen or break. </p>

<p>Store on metal shelves, preferably powder-coated steel or chrome-plated steel shelves and components. Avoid wood. If wood is unavoidable, made certain that it is properly sealed to reduce these gaseous emissions. Avoid oil-based sealants and paints. Always elect for non-toxic or low VOC (volatile organic compound) sealants/paints, if available. Recommended sealants include water-based polyurethane or two-part epoxy sealant.</p>

<!-- Q: Does this item have an appropriate container in good condition? -->

<h2 id="container">Storage Container</h2>

<p>Valuable or very fragile books may require their own enclosures. This could be as simple as a paper wrapping or as complex as a custom clamshell box depending on the condition and value of the item. Custom boxes may be constructed in-house using archival (acid-free) materials available through many archival supply companies.</p>

<p>If possible, books of similar size should be shelved together so that they are equally supported on both sides.

When removing a book from the shelf, grip it on both sides of the spine near the middle of the book and slide it out from the shelf. Do not pull a book from the shelf by the headcap; it may loosen, break, or cause the spine to tear.

Regular housekeeping, including dusting and wiping down shelves as well as collection materials, prevents the accumulation of dirt and debris on and around collection materials as necessary. Dust absorbs and holds moisture, which promotes mold growth, pest damage, and accelerates deterioration.

Dark storage is best if possible, and lights should be turned off in storage areas when patrons and staff are not present. UV filters should be applied on fluorescent light tubes and windows in these areas.

If possible, shelves should not be butted up directly against outside walls and should be placed away from radiators, vents and other areas where temperature and RH fluctuate.</p>


<!-- Q: Does the container or item have any meaningful labeling? -->

<h2 id="storage-label">Labeling</h2>

<p><em>If your item has any kind of labeling on the container, the item itself, or any related material we highly recommend that you return to the Basic Info section and enter this information in the appropriate field(s).</em></p>

<p>Labeling on a container or on the item itself, if it is in fact correct, can offer important clues about its content. If you are replacing a container that holds labeling information, it is important to transfer this information to the new container or label. Be sure to copy down any titles, dates or other data found on these items&mdash;and save notes. Container labels should be used with caution as they are frequently reused or easily switched by accident.</p>

<p>For sleeves and folders especially remember that it's generally best to label with a no. 2 pencil. If ink must be used (i.e. on a plastic enclosure), use an archival pigment-ink pen (e.g. Micron).</p>

<!-- SECTION: Condition -->

<!-- Q: What is the state of the image, in terms of physical damage sustained? -->

<h2 id="damage">Physical Damage</h2>

<p>The deterioration of a book (or any bound item) will greatly depend on the materials used to make it, including the cover and binding materials as well as type of paper used for the textblock. Mishandling and heavy use may cause damage or soiling. Common forms of damage due to mishandling include broken hinges, headcaps, and sewing, and damage (folding and tearing) to boards and pages. Book cradles should be available so books are not opened too far, putting stress on the sewn or glued binding.</p>

<p>Regardless of its acidity and inherent vice, all paper is susceptible to tearing and other forms of mechanical damage. Water exposure can affect the structural integrity of paper, leading to desiccated or brittle paper, which is more easily torn and damaged through handling. If paper has been folded, creased areas will be especially vulnerable to tearing. </p>

<!-- Q: To what degree is this damage affecting visual information (image, text)?  -->

<h2 id="visualinfo">Impact of Damage on Visual Information</h2>

<p>When evaluating the impact of damage on visual information, look for mechanical damage as well as deterioration and decay that obscures or limits access to information. This could include yellowing and embrittlement, damage especially symptomatic of newsprint and other wood pulp papers. It could also include fading, darkening, warping, cockling, blocking (especially of coated papers), tearing, mold, and insect infestation.</p>

<p>Adhesives used may also deteriorate over time and cause the binding to weaken or come apart. Rubber-based and animal hide glues are particularly unstable. Environmental factors such as temperature, relative humidity, and pollutants may result in deterioration of paper and other materials used in the binding. Fluctuating temperature and RH cause paper to swell and contract, which can put stress on the binding and covers. This stress may manifest in the form of cockling, deformed covers, or loose binding. High heat will cause paper to yellow and become brittle, and will accelerate deterioration. An environment with a stable temperature below 65°F and relative humidity between 35–45% will preserve items and helps prevent pest infestation and mold.</p>

<p>Foxing is a common form of paper deterioration and is frequently seen in books. Although the exact causes of foxing are varied and not easily identified, but is often the result of fungal growth or metal impurities present in the paper combined with high humidity. Foxing will appear as reddish-brown (rusty) flecks on the paper. They can appear across the surface, or be situated in clusters in "bullseye" (small and round, dark center) or "snowflake" (larger, irregularly shaped blotches) shapes.</p>

<p>Red rot is a type of deterioration particular to leather. It is common in leather bindings produced between the 19th centuries. The exact cause of red rot is unknown, but it is believed to be the result of acidic residue in the leather reacting to poor environmental conditions (pollutants and high heat especially). Red rotted leather is characterized as soft, powdery, crumbling into a reddish brown powder. There is no way to reverse this deterioration, but the leather can be consolidated so it does not crumble further. Consult a conservator before applying consolidants to objects. An alternative treatment, which does not stop the red rot but contains it for easier handling, is to cover the book in a polyethylene sleeve or wrap it in acid-free paper.</p>

<!-- Q: Is this item exhibiting mold and/or pest (insect, rodent) damage?  -->

<h2 id="moldpest">Mold / Pest Damage</h2>
<p> Mold may develop on items stored in a warm, damp environment. Fluctuating temperature and RH may also cause mold to bloom. Mold can leave staining, even when it is no longer active. Pests may leave physical damage or stain cover material and pages (particularly silverfish, cockroaches, and rodents).</p>

Mishandling and heavy use may cause damage or soiling. Common forms of damage due to mishandling include broken hinges, headcaps, and sewing, and damage (folding and tearing) to boards and pages. Book cradles should be available so books are not opened too far, putting stress on the sewn or glued binding.
<p>Pests like insects and rodents tend to like paper and textile materials. High humidity (higher than 68% RH) promotes mold growth and insect infestation, both of which can cause permanent damage. When assessing the exposure of your collections to pests, it is necessary to look not just at the materials themselves and their containers&mdash;it is also important to look around at the larger environment. Insects and rodents tend to leave droppings in areas they inhabit. Insects tend to leave behind a substance called frass, which is the undigested fibers from paper. If you see droppings and/or frass in the storage area it is a strong sign that your materials are being exposed to pests. Small, irregular holes on paper-based enclosures are also a sign that pests have attacked your materials.</p>

<p>Some tips for reducing your materials' exposure to pests are to refrain from eating anywhere near your collections materials. Crumbs and food waste draw pests, so eat far from your collections. Another tip applying to both pests and mold is to be cautious about donated materials when you receive them. Pests and mold can hitch a ride into your facility on these materials, so having a good, clean staging area where you can inspect donated items for, among other things, pest and mold evidence can help you reduce your storage environments' exposure to both.</p>

<!-- Q: Is the paper discolored and/or brittle? -->

<h2 id="decay-paper">Paper Decay</h2>

<p>All paper is susceptible to discoloration and embrittlement as a result of exposure to humidity, light, and atmospheric pollutants. While binding may offer some protection from deteriorating agents, materials and processes employed in binding paper may also accelerate paper deterioration. </p>

<h3 id="uncoatedinkjet">Uncoated paper</h3>

<p>Uncoated paper is typically used for printing documents, and does not yield high-quality image reproductions.  The amount of ink used to print images usually causes the paper to cockle.  Since the ink is absorbed directly by the paper, images are not vibrant or sharp.  Some uncoated papers, marketed especially for inkjet printers, are treated to address these problems; however print quality is still lower than prints made with swellable or porous paper.  Images printed on uncoated paper are likely the result of a consumer-grade inkjet printer and were probably printed in a home or office.  Commercially produced prints are typically made on coated papers.</p>

<h3 id="swellableinkjet">Swellable coated paper</h3>

<p>Swellable paper is comprised of resin-coated paper with an image-receiving layer.  The image-receiving layer swells to absorb the liquid ink as it is sprayed during the printing process.  This results in a vibrant, crisp image that sits in a layer on top of the paper rather than absorbing into it.  Only dye-based inks are used to print on swellable paper, since pigment inks cannot absorb into the image-receiving layer.  Swellable paper typically has a glossy finish which mimics traditional photo paper prints.  Images printed on coated swellable paper may be produced professionally or at home.  Swellable papers have decreased in popularity due to the fact that prints take some time to dry completely (sometimes up to 24 hours), as opposed to porous papers which dry instantly.</p>

<h3 id="porousinkjet">Porous coated paper</h3>

<p>Porous paper is comprised of paper, with optional resin-coating, with a surface layer of mineral particles attached to the paper by a polymer binder.  These mineral particles create tiny pores on the surface of the paper which absorb ink and dry instantly.  Porous paper typically is not as glossy as swellable paper, and is manufactured with and without the RC layer.  Porous paper without RC layers may be classified as "fine art paper" and is used to produce fine art prints, or giclée prints (not all fine art inkjet papers are porous papers, however).  Images printed on porous paper may be produced professionally or at home.  Inkjet prints on porous paper are more susceptible to abrasion than prints on swellable paper.</p>

<p>Acidic paper (pH below 7.0) commonly exhibits both deteriorative traits. Colored media on the paper support will fade rapidly. Water exposure can ultimately lead to desiccated or brittle paper, therefore more easily torn or damaged through handling. Fluctuating temperature and RH may result in warping, cockling of the paper surface. High humidity (higher than 68% RH) promotes mold growth and insect infestation, both of which can cause permanent damage.</p>

<p>According to a study by the Library of Congress, even pH neutral papers will become increasingly acidic over time. This is due to the fact that cellulose naturally generates acids as it ages. Papers, including book leaves, that are darker and more brittle along their edges than center demonstrate an absorption of airborne pollutants that have formed acids.</p>

<p>Soil and dust may become ground into paper fibers, permanently soiling or staining the paper surface. Foxing is a common form of paper deterioration which manifests as reddish-brown spots or blotches which appear embedded in the paper surface. Foxing is caused by a number of factors, but is commonly spurred along by high humidity.</p>


<!-- Q: What proportion of the ink/media is "at risk"? -->

<h2 id="inkmediarisk">Ink/Media Deterioration</h2>

<p>Inkjet prints may be made with a variety of CMYK dyes and pigments, often dependent on the type of paper used. Preservation risks are highly variable, depending on ink and paper type, colorants (dye or pigment), receiving layer, even original printer settings. Inkjet prints are prone to yellowing and staining, especially if exposed to high humidity, intense light, or atmospheric pollutants such as ozone. Ink bleeding, streaking, and distortion may occur if exposed to moisture. Pigment-based inks are considerably more stable than dye-based, but may also be water-based—and thusly sensitive to moisture.</p>

<h3 id="dyeinkjet">Dye-based ink</h3>

<p>Dye-based inks are cheaper and therefore used more widely than pigment-based inks, in both home and office settings.  Dye inks, however, are prone to a number of preservation issues.  Dye inks are very sensitive to moisture and will spread and run if even a single drop of water is introduced to the print surface.</p>

<h3 id="pigmentinkjet">Pigment-based ink</h3>

<p>Pigment inks resist water quite well and are less likely to run or smear due to moisture.  Pigment inks are also more lightfast than dye-based inks, and, if printed on a good-quality paper, may last more than 100 years before any fading occurs.  The main preservation concern with pigment ink prints is that pigment inks are more prone to abrasion, especially in areas of dense, dark color.  Pigment inks may also be identified by a differential surface gloss between areas of high ink density and areas where no ink is present.</p>

<p>Characteristics of ink and other media vary depending on their composition and method of formulation. As such, the stability of media has a long-term effect on its paper support, and vice versa. It should be assumed that all media has potential to fade under extreme light exposure and that ink will bleed or transfer if exposed to moisture.</p>

<!-- Q: Is the cover/case still attached to the textblock? -->

<h2 id="coverattach">Cover Attachment</h2>
<p> Over time, covers may be become detached from textblocks. The risk of this is dependent on a variety of factors, but is more likely if the item is bound with an adhesive, rather than sewn. <a href="http://psap.library.illinois.edu/format-id-guide/bookbound#adhesivebind" target="_blank">Perfect bindings</a> are especially susceptible to cover detachment, since the binding process does not allow adhesive to penetrate between the sheets of the text block, limiting the surface area of the text block that adheres to the spine. Eventually, the internal hinge of a bound item may loosen and pull away from the cover.   


<!-- Q: What is the condition of the cover material? -->

<h2 id="covermaterial">Cover Materials</h2>

<p>Cover materials are highly dependent on publication era, location, and purpose of the item. Leather and cloth are the two most common covering materials, but books may be bound in <a href="http://psap.library.illinois.edu/format-id-guide/paper" target="_blank">paper</a>, <a href="http://psap.library.illinois.edu/format-id-guide/bookbound#tawedskin" target="_blank">tawed skin</a>, and <a href="http://psap.library.illinois.edu/format-id-guide/parchment" target="_blank">parchment</a>.</p>

<h3>Leather</h3>

<p>Leather was the most common covering material until the 19th century, and continues to be used today. Leather used for books is most often calf, goat, pigskin, sheepskin. Different leathers have varying durability but in terms of preservation should be treated the same. Leather is prepared by removing the hair mechanically or with chemicals, followed by a tanning process. Leather produced through the 16th century is generally stable and often found in good condition due to the slow tanning process which resulted in leather that was resistant to decay and acid deterioration (Ritzenthaler, 2010). As demand for books grew in the 17th century, so too did the demand for leather.</p>

<p>Split leather: Leather, particularly that which is used in bookbinding, has often been split in order to thin the top-grain by separating it from its underside. This "drop split" may be used to produce suede. Suede is produced from the underside of softer animal skins (lamb, goat, calf) or produced through splitting the hides of thicker cow or deer skins. As it does not include the exterior skin layer, it is therefore softer (and fuzzy), less durable, and more susceptible to staining and water damage than full-grain leather. Suede was used for books in the 19th century.</p>

<p>Leather from the 19th century will often deteriorate quickly due to the aggressive chemicals used to speed up the tanning process. All leather is inherently acidic, but excessive acidity in combination with exposure to atmospheric pollutants may result in "red rot," a form of leather decomposition that appears soft and will crumble into a reddish-brown powder. Historically, leather dressings have been applied to leather bindings with the intention of preserving the leather’s surface and suppleness. However, recent research may suggest that these dressings likely do not provide any noticeable preservative effect to leather bindings (McCrady, 1993).</p>

<p>Books with slight leather components might be referred to (inaccurately) as "leather bound." Here are more specific terms regarding the ratio of cover and spine materials: "Full binding" is a term used in which the cover and spine is covered in one material (e.g. leather); "half binding" if a material is split across the spine and only slightly across the sides, at roughly a 1:1 ratio to another material; "quarter binding" if only the spine is covered (1:3). </p>

<h3>Cloth</h3>
<p>Book cloth came into widespread use in the 19th century, c. 1821. Prior to the that, books were primarily bound in leather. An array of fabrics have been used—particularly earlier in the 19th century—including silk, velvet, and starch-filled muslin. Cotton and linen have most common, however.  Buckram is a sturdy cotton (or linen) cloth coated and calendared for use as a book cloth. Book cloth may also be embossed with different textures and can be made to imitate the texture of leather. There are three main types of book cloth treatments: starch-filled, pyroxylin-treated, and acrylic-coated.</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Starch-filled cloth</strong> originally was a colored and sized muslin. Starch-filled cloth is still in use today and is produced by coating cloth with a slurry of water, starch, clay, and pigment. It is chemically <li> <strong>Pyroxylin-treated cloth</strong> (often buckram) is created with the use of solvents. This process was introduced in the late 19th century. It is durable, though not as chemically stable as starch-filled cloth. It becomes stiff in low temperatures and may become tacky in high temperatures. It may be wiped clean with a damp cloth and is resistant to moisture and insects. Buckram is primarily used as a book covering for circulating library collections and bound journals (library bindings).</li>
<li> <strong>Acrylic-coated cloth</strong> is chemically stable and resistant to moisture, mold, and insects.</li>
</ul>
