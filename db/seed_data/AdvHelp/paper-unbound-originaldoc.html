<!-- Q: Is this item viewed/handled regularly? -->

<h2 id="handlinguse">Risks of Handling/Use</h2>

<p>Generally, handling and use heightens the risk of damage to your materials, be it through neglectful handling (e.g. touching photo emulsion with bare hands) or irresponsible operation of access equipment. This is a risk posed by patrons and staff alike, intentional or not.</p>

<h3>Handling and Management</h3>
<p>Examples of neglect, mishandling, and mismanagement include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pressure-sensitive tape to mend tears;</li>
<li>Ink pens to label back of a photographic print;</li>
<li>Folding materials to fit into a given box or enclosure;</li>
<li>Poor handling: always use gloves (when handling sensitive emulsions) or wash and dry hands before handling (when handling fragile paper-based documents);</li>
<li>Inadequate packaging for shipping;</li>
<li>Lack of intellectual control over holdings, leading to harmful and excessive use of unique or vulnerable items.  Instead introduce guides/finding aids for patron use.</li>
</ul>

<p>General recommendations include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Wearing gloves (cotton, nitrile) while handling archival photographic emulsion materials; </li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t wear gloves while handling fragile documents;</li>
<li>Use only light pencils for direct labeling on a photo verso;</li>
<li>Use only PAT-compliant storage enclosure materials allowed, etc.;</li>
<li>Introduce guides/finding aids for patron use, including notes for proper handling of fragile materials;</li>
<li>Ensure that archival staff, volunteers, and patrons are adequately trained in handling collection materials;</li>
<li>Use enclosures, book carts, and other equipment as appropriate to minimize risk to materials during transport.
</li>
</ul>


<!-- Q: Are there additional copies, facsimiles, and/or access copies of this image? -->


<h2 id="copies">Additional Copies</h2>
<p> The use of additional copies for reference or display purposes is highly recommended, particularly if the item is an original or valuable. This provides broader access to the content while also protecting the original document from user wear and tear or environmental factors.</p>

<p>Recommendations for care of original object:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ideally, originals should be used once to produce an access copy, facsimile, or surrogate;</li> 
<li>Copies would then be put to use by the institution in place of the original, sustaining the wear and tear of patron use or prolonged exhibition;</li> 
<li>These measures save the original from the wear and tear of use;</li>
</ul>

<!-- SECTION: Storage | Container -->

<!-- Q: Is this item properly supported in storage? -->

<h2 id="orientation">Orientation in Storage</h2>

<p>Store flat. If flat storage is not possible, flexible, sturdy paper items may be stored rolled around a tube. Paper items should not be folded, as folding creates areas of weakness in the paper making it prone to tearing. </p>



<!-- Q: Does this item have an appropriate container in good condition? -->

<h2 id="container">Storage Container</h2>

<p>Document-sized paper should be stored in archival folders, boxes, or files. Oversize items are best stored flat in a flat file drawer, with items kept separate or with like materials of similar dimensions (interleaved with acid-free sheets) in specially tailored folders, cut from acid-free, buffered paper. Enclosures and folders may be stored in hanging files or archival storage boxes. </p>


<!-- Q: Does the container or item have any meaningful labeling? -->

<h2 id="storage-label">Labeling</h2>

<p><em>If your item has any kind of labeling on the container, the item itself, or any related material we highly recommend that you return to the Basic Info section and enter this information in the appropriate field(s).</em></p>

<p>Labeling on a container or on the item itself, if it is in fact correct, can offer important clues about its content. If you are replacing a container that holds labeling information, it is important to transfer this information to the new container or label. Be sure to copy down any titles, dates or other data found on these items&mdash;and save notes. Container labels should be used with caution as they are frequently reused or easily switched by accident.</p>

<p>For sleeves and folders especially remember that it's generally best to label with a no. 2 pencil. If ink must be used (i.e. on a plastic enclosure), use an archival pigment-ink pen (e.g. Micron).</p>

<!-- SECTION: Condition -->

<!-- Q: What is the state of the image, in terms of physical damage sustained? -->

<h2 id="damage">Physical Damage</h2>

<p>Regardless of its acidity and inherent vice, all paper is susceptible to tearing and other forms of mechanical damage. Water exposure can affect the structural integrity of paper, leading to desiccated or brittle paper, which is more easily torn and damaged through handling. If paper has been folded, creased areas will be especially vulnerable to tearing. </p>

<p>Unbound paper may be damaged by fasteners like paper clips, and are especially at risk during removal of fasteners. Metal fasteners that are not stainless steel will eventually corrode, and plastic fasteners may cause warping. For information on the correct removal of fasteners, consult the NEDCC leaflet <a href="https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/7.-conservation-procedures/7.8-removal-of-damaging-fasteners-from-historic-documents" target="_blank">7.8 Removal of Damaging Fasteners from Historic Documents</a>. </p>

<!-- Q: To what degree is this damage affecting visual information (image, text)?  -->

<h2 id="visualinfo">Impact of Damage on Visual Information</h2>

<p>When evaluating the impact of damage on visual information, look for mechanical damage as well as deterioration and decay that obscures or limits access to information. This could include yellowing and embrittlement, damage especially symptomatic of newsprint and other wood pulp papers. It could also include fading, darkening, warping, cockling, blocking (especially of coated papers), tearing, mold, and insect infestation.</p>

<!-- Q: Is this item exhibiting mold and/or pest (insect, rodent) damage?  -->

<h2 id="moldpest">Mold / Pest Damage</h2>

<p>Pests like insects and rodents tend to like paper and textile materials. High humidity (higher than 68% RH) promotes mold growth and insect infestation, both of which can cause permanent damage. When assessing the exposure of your collections to pests, it is necessary to look not just at the materials themselves and their containers&mdash;it is also important to look around at the larger environment. Insects and rodents tend to leave droppings in areas they inhabit. Insects tend to leave behind a substance called frass, which is the undigested fibers from paper. If you see droppings and/or frass in the storage area it is a strong sign that your materials are being exposed to pests. Small, irregular holes on paper-based enclosures are also a sign that pests have attacked your materials.</p>

<p>Some tips for reducing your materials' exposure to pests are to refrain from eating anywhere near your collections materials. Crumbs and food waste draw pests, so eat far from your collections. Another tip applying to both pests and mold is to be cautious about donated materials when you receive them. Pests and mold can hitch a ride into your facility on these materials, so having a good, clean staging area where you can inspect donated items for, among other things, pest and mold evidence can help you reduce your storage environments' exposure to both.</p>

<!-- Q: Is the paper discolored and/or brittle? -->

<h2 id="decay-paper">Paper Decay</h2>

<p>Paper is sensitive to light and water exposure, high humidity, and high heat. Exposure to light and/or heat will accelerate deterioration in the form of yellowing and sometimes embrittlement.</p>

<p>Acidic paper (pH below 7.0) commonly exhibits both deteriorative traits. Colored media on the paper support will fade rapidly. Water exposure can ultimately lead to desiccated or brittle paper, therefore more easily torn or damaged through handling. Fluctuating temperature and RH may result in warping, cockling of the paper surface. High humidity (higher than 68% RH) promotes mold growth and insect infestation, both of which can cause permanent damage.</p>

<p>According to a study by the Library of Congress, even pH neutral papers will become increasingly acidic over time. This is due to the fact that cellulose naturally generates acids as it ages. Papers, including book leaves, that are darker and more brittle along their edges than center demonstrate an absorption of airborne pollutants that have formed acids.</p>

<p>Soil and dust may become ground into paper fibers, permanently soiling or staining the paper surface. Foxing is a common form of paper deterioration which manifests as reddish-brown spots or blotches which appear embedded in the paper surface. Foxing is caused by a number of factors, but is commonly spurred along by high humidity.</p>

<!-- Q: What proportion of the ink/media is "at risk"? -->

<h2 id="inkmediarisk">Ink/Media Deterioration</h2>

<p>Characteristics of ink and other media vary depending on their composition and method of formulation. As such, the stability of media has a long-term effect on its paper support, and vice versa. It should be assumed that all media has potential to fade under extreme light exposure and that ink will bleed or transfer if exposed to moisture.</p>
