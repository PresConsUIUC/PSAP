<h1>Other/Unknown Media Types</h1>
<p>There are many kinds of media formats. AvSAP was designed to assess audiovisual formats most commonly found in institutions in the United States. As comprehensive as AvSAP is, we recognize that you may have formats in your collections that don't fit into the format types we've listed on this page. If you find you have a media type that AvSAP doesn't cover, there are resources to which you may turn to find out more about that media type's care. Following is a list of professional organizations and their email listservs. If you find you have a format that you can't identify, posting a message to these lists can usually put you in touch with a professional who can help you learn more about it.</p>
