<h1>Microforms</h1>
<p>Microform is a generic term used to describe formats containing microreproductions of documents and images. Microforms can be plastic film (microfilm, microfiche), paper (microcard, microprint), or a combination of the two (aperture card, a microfilm cell embedded in a punchcard). Microfilm is a roll film and microfiche is a sheet film; either may contain negative or positive images (but negative is more common). A microcard is a photosensitive paper card (like any photo print) and a microprint is simply ink printed on a card. An aperture card is a microfilm image/cell mounted in a punch card. Information regarding the photographic film formats (microfilm, microfiche) listed below presumes predominant use of the silver-gelatin image process. For information on alternative image processes, see diazo, vesicular, and others in the Microfilm Processes section below.</p>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd> Microfilm is comprised of a plastic support (nitrate, acetate, or polyester) with a silver-gelatin emulsion.  It is typically 16mm or 35mm roll film, usually unperforated.  A larger 105mm was used for the transfer to preservation microfiche but is only occasionally found in collections.  Microfilm images may be positive or negative (typically negative), a master or duplicate. Most are silver-gelatin, but diazo microfilm (dye-based) and vesicular microfilm (thermally processed) may also be present.  Rolls are often stored on an open reel and in some cases a cartridge or cassette.  A 16mm film roll may be 100 feet, 130 feet or 215 feet in length and is used to film legal size or smaller documents.  Standard 35mm roll film length is 100 feet and is used to film larger documents.  Documents may be filmed in any number of reduction ratios, ranging from 5:1 to 22:1 on 35mm film.  16mm film was usually made using reduction ratios of 18:1 to 24:1.</dd>

  <dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>
  <p>The silver image on a B&W silver-gelatin microfilm is relatively stable, however all silver-gelatin emulsions are susceptible to redox blemishing (also called "measles" or "microspots") and silver mirroring.</p>
    <p>Nitrate: Cellulose nitrate film deterioration is exacerbated by either a humid or dry environment.  In a humid environment, the emulsion may soften and become sticky.  In a dry environment the film becomes brittle.  In the final stage of deterioration, nitrate film forms a solid mass than cannot be separated or handled safely.  Nitrate film deterioration can be identified by the acrid, sharp odor as nitric and nitrous acids are released.  These acidic vapors are damaging to surrounding objects, so deteriorating film must be evaluated to determine whether it should be discarded.</p>
    <p>Acetate: Cellulose acetate film is susceptible to vinegar syndrome, causing the film base to shrink and the gelatin emulsion to pull up in folds.  This form of deterioration is known as channeling.  A strong vinegar odor is a telltale symptom in later stages of deterioration. Acetate deterioration is accelerated by humid conditions.</p>
    <p>Polyester: Polyester film is inert, considered archival, and has a life expectancy of 500+ years under proper storage conditions.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd>
  <p>Nitrate: High; Acetate: Moderately high; Polyester: Low. The silver image on a B&W silver-gelatin microfilm is relatively stable, but susceptible to redox blemishing and silver mirroring.  However, the plastic supports are often unstable and prone to deterioration (unless polyester).</p> 
   
    <p>In the case of the rare, early period nitrate-based microfilm, preservation risk is very high.  Acetate film is at a moderately high risk level and should be monitored closely for signs of deterioration. Polyester-based film is a low preservation risk.</p>
    
    <p>Both nitrate and acetate films may damage nearby materials if they are in an advanced state of deterioration; film displaying signs of deterioration should be separated from other collections and evaluated for conservation, digitization, or discard.</p>

  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>Microfilm has been produced since the 1930s and continues to be produced today, although microform production has steadily declined since the 1990s.  Rene Dagron held the first microfilm patent in 1859, but the technology was not widely used for reproducing the printed page until after World War II.  Microfilm is often used to create preservation and access copies of rare or deteriorating documents.  Microfilm’s rise to popularity began in 1935 when Recordak, a division of Kodak, used a 35mm microfilm camera to film and publish the New York Times on microfilm.  Microfilm was quickly adopted as a solution to the many preservation and storage issues inherent in newspaper collections and was also widely used for government records.  It was also used extensively during and after World War II, for correspondence and to provide insurance against the potential wartime destruction of documents and archives.  Microfilm became more widely used in libraries through the 1950s and 60s, as technology improved and libraries sought storage solutions for their expanding collections.  Although microfilm has largely been replaced by digital alternatives, large collections still exist in academic and public libraries, and microfilm is still sometimes used as a preservation solution for materials such as newspapers.</dd>

  <dt>Storage Enclosure(s)</dt>
  <dd>Polyester films should be stored in high-quality sealed metal cans or inert plastic containers (polyester, polyethylene, or polypropylene; not polyvinylchloride [PVC] or vinyl) in order to protect them from gaseous contaminants and to provide a buffer against humidity and temperature changes.  Acetate films should be stored in ventilated containers, or containers sealed with molecular sieves to allow for off-gassing of acetic acid that occurs in acetate film.  All enclosures should pass the Photographic Activity Test.  Paper enclosures and boxes should be of high-quality, lignin-free, buffered or neutral material.  Enclosures that are sealed with adhesive should be avoided, when possible, and microfilm should never be secured using a rubber band.  &quot;Microfilm reels should be individually boxed, with film held in the wound position by a preservation-quality paper tag secured with a string and button tie"  (Dalton, n.d.).  Steel or inert plastic filing cabinets are ideal for microfilm storage, and should allow enough space for the items to be inserted and removed easily without buckling or curling.  When possible, microfilms on different film bases should be stored separately.</dd>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd> Microfiche is comprised of a plastic support (acetate [1930s&ndash;1980s] or polyester [1960s&ndash;present]) typically with a silver-gelatin emulsion.  Standard microfiche is a flat film measuring 4"  &#215; 6" . Microfiche commonly appears as a grid of micro images unreadable without the aid of a light reader.  Microfiche images may be positive or negative, a master or a duplicate. Most are silver-gelatin, but diazo microfiche (dye-based: light sensitive) and vesicular microfiche (thermally processed: heat sensitive) may also be present.  Pages will often be reduced at a ratio of 24x, but also as much as 48x their actual size. Flat film may also be used to capture large documents or engineering drawings at 20x reduction.  Some types of microfiche were updateable, allowing new images to be added up to three years after the first image was placed on the fiche.  A jacket of microfilm strips are also sometimes referred to as microfiche.</dd>

  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>An early form of microfiche was invented at the turn of the century but was not commercially introduced until the mid-1930s, and did not see widespread adoption until the 1950s (although some claim microfiche was invented in 1961).  The 4"  &#215; 6"  microfiche sheet film proliferated in North America throughout the 1960s, when microfilming became part of standard reformatting policy in libraries and government agencies.  Microfiche remains available today, although microform production collectively has declined steadily since the 1990s.</dd>

  <dd>Microprint is an opaque 6"  &#215; 9"  support paper with a mechanically printed ink image.  Appearing largely in research libraries, Readex Microprint Corporation produced the first of the micro-reproduction formats on heavy, opaque paper. Many of the Readex microprints will be labeled as such&mdash;look along the descriptive info printed along the outer margins.  Unlike the microcard, the microprint is produced through a mechanical printing process.  Microprint cards are printed using the offset lithography process, and may show some ink squash, particularly on calendered (glossy) papers.  Under low magnification, some ink will appear to have penetrated the paper, giving images soft edges.</dd>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>An aperture card is comprised of a microfilm cell (plastic film base [nitrate, acetate, or polyester], gelatin binder, and silver image) mounted in a thick paper or cardboard punch card.  The card has a rectangular cutout in which the microfilm cell is mounted.  The microfilm is either contained in a clear plastic sleeve or secured over the hole by adhesive tape.  The card is punched with machine-readable metadata (Hollerith holes) associated with the image; sometimes this information is also printed or typed on the card.  The content of the film is usually a reference document or image, such as an engineering drawing, map, or other large single-page document.</dd>

  <dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Deterioration of the paper/cardboard card depends on the quality of the material, however all types of paper are susceptible to mechanical damage such as tears. </p>
    <p>Nitrate:  Nitrate film deterioration is exacerbated by either a humid or dry environment.  In a humid environment, the emulsion may soften and become sticky.  In a dry environment the film becomes brittle.  In the final stage of deterioration, nitrate film forms a solid mass that cannot be separated or handled safely.  Nitrate deterioration can be identified by the acrid, sharp odor as nitric and nitrous acids are released.  These acidic vapors are damaging to surrounding objects, so deteriorating film must be evaluated to determine whether it should be discarded. </p>
    <p>Acetate:  Cellulose acetate film is susceptible to vinegar syndrome, causing the film base to shrink and the gelatin emulsion to pull up in folds.  A strong vinegar odor is a telltale symptom in later stages of deterioration. Acetate deterioration is accelerated by high humidity. </p>
    <p>Polyester:  Polyester film is inert, considered archival and has a life expectancy of 500+ years under proper storage conditions. </p>
    <p>Regardless of the film base, all silver-gelatin microfilm is susceptible to redox blemishes (also called &quot;measles"  or &quot;microspots" ).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd> Moderate to high. In the case of nitrate-based microfilm, the preservation risk level is high.  Acetate film is at a moderate risk level and should be monitored closely for signs of deterioration.  Both nitrate and acetate films may damage nearby materials if they are in an advanced state of deterioration; nitrate and acetate films displaying signs of deterioration should be separated from other collections and evaluated for conservation, digitization, or discard.  Polyester-based microfilm is a low preservation risk.  The paper card on which the microfilm is mounted will deteriorate differently depending on the type of paper used.</dd>
  <dt>Common Size(s)</dt>
  <dd>7 ⅜"  &#215; 3 ¼"  card containing one frame of a 35mm microfilm or several frames of a 16mm film.</dd>
  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>Aperture cards were developed in 1943 and were used until the 1990s.  They were originally developed to capture photographs of strategic military value and make them available on request to Army and Navy intelligence (LoTurco, 2004).  In the 1950s government agencies and engineering companies began using aperture cards for filing engineering drawings.  By the 1960s aperture cards were being used internationally.  In addition to being used for engineering drawings, aperture cards were also used to preserve public records, medical records, and government/defense and other information.</dd>

  <li>Acetate (1925&ndash;early 1980s)</li>
  <li>Polyester (early 1980s&ndash;present)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the film bases should be considered photographic film bases, as they are chemically identical, and will deteriorate and be identified in a similar manner.</p>
<p>Polyester is the only film support in use today (and since the early 1980s) and the only one suggested for archival use.  Silver-gelatin black-and-white on polyester is the only microfilm recommended for preservation, with a 500+ year life expectancy under proper storage conditions as outlined by ANSI standards.</p>
<h2><a id="storagenotes">Microfilm Storage</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Particulate air pollutants are the source of scratches and abrasions. Particularly vulnerable are silver-gelatin films.</li>
  <li>Gaseous air contaminants: sulfur and nitrogen oxides, paint fumes, ammonia, peroxides, ozone and formaldehyde will damage bases and emulsions. These gases can produce oxidizing or effects that cause small spots (redox blemishes) on silver-gelatin films.</li>
  <li>Microforms should not be stored near photocopiers. </li>
  <li>Microforms should be removed from areas that are to be painted&ndash;and kept out of area for 3 months.</li>
  <li>Microforms of value should not be stored on wooden shelving for any long-term period.</li>
  <li>Silver-gelatin, diazo, and vesicular films are ideally stored in separate containers. Keeping older vesicular separate from other films is especially crucial as their deterioration releases damaging acids into the environment.</li>

<h2>Microfilm Processes</h2>
<p>Note: None of the three microfilm types below should share containers or enclosures, if possible.</p>
<h3><a id="silvergelmicro">Silver-gelatin microfilm</a></h3>
<dl>
  <dt>Synonym</dt>
  <dd>Silver halide microfilm</dd>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Silver-gelatin is the only preservation quality microfilm. Structurally it is the same as a silver-gelatin photo negative.  The process is generally used for archival/preservation microfilm.  The quality of the image is ideally fine-grained with high contrast.  The emulsion side is dull while the film base side is glossy.  Life expectancy is as high as 500+ years if processed and stored according to ANSI standards. </dd>
  <dt>Support</dt>
  <dd>Polyester, acetate, or nitrate</dd>
  <dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>Silver-gelatin microfilm is subject to oxidation, often exhibiting small, reddish redox blemishes (sometimes called &quot;measles,"  &quot;microspots" ).  Silver-gelatin microfilm will deteriorate more rapidly if exposed to high temperatures, humidity, residual chemicals and pollutants.  The emulsion is easily scratched and can be damaged by use in a reader; in addition to its long life expectancy, this sensitivity to abrasion makes silver-gelatin microfilm suitable for preservation copies, but not for use as service copies.</dd>
</dl>
<h3><a id="diazomicro">Diazo microfilm</a></h3>
<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Diazo is a duplicate process intended for use as service copies.  Diazonium salts in the film emulsion combine with dye couplers to produce strong, dense colors.  Diazo microfilming may produce a variety of colors, including black, which is a composite of color dyes. Resistance to image fading depends on the variations of both diazo and dye coupler.  B&W diazo resembles silver-gelatin film but is glossy on both sides.  Diazo has a life expectancy of up to 100 years under proper storage conditions.</dd>
  <dt>Support</dt>
  <dd>Acetate or polyester</dd>
  <dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>Diazo microfilm will fade on any exposure to light; fading is accelerated by intense light exposure, for instance by use in a light reader.  Though stable, heat can cause diazo dye components to fade, producing signs of discoloration.  Like silver-gelatin microfilm, diazo is subject to fungal growth under adverse temperature and relative humidity levels.</dd>

  <dd>Kalvar; Thermal microfilm</dd>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Vesicular microfilming is a duplication process intended for use as service copies. It contains a diazonium salt coating which is sandwiched between two polyester layers. During processing, expanding nitrogen forms tiny bubbles (or vesicles) in exposed areas that remain when the film is cooled. The image is formed by heating the film to form these bubbles or "vesicles" inside the film. The image will exhibit slightly raised areas. The film will have a bluish color.</dd>
  <dt>Dates</dt>
  <dd>Emerged c. 1957</dd>
  <dt>Support</dt>
  <dd>Polyester</dd>
  <dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>Vesicular microfilm is extremely vulnerable to prolonged heat exposure; temperatures over 160&deg;F may result in image loss (Kodak, 2002). Image deterioration results from deformation or damage to the bubbles, by way of pressure and/or heat.  Vesicular films may also release acidic gases as they deteriorate&ndash;store vesicular apart from all other films.</dd>

<dl>
  <dt>Color microfilm</dt>
  <dd>A silver-aided process, typically a silver dye-bleach film.  While no color process is considered to be genuinely preservation quality, due to dye’s susceptibility to fading, the Ilfochrome color transparency film comes close. This is because film’s color layers are built directly into the emulsion. The image stability of the dyes that comprise the image may, according to estimates, last 300 to 500 years if kept in proper storage conditions, i.e. in the dark and in extremely low temperature and relative humidity.</dd>
