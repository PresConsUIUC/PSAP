<h1>Book/Bound Items</h1>
<p>A book consists predominantly of paper and/or parchment leaves, often with assorted isolated components, all of which is sewn together or attached with adhesive, and attached to a cover. Conventionally the textblock was made from large sheets of paper or parchment which were folded down to the desired size. The pages in "quarto" and smaller volumes then had to be cut open. Before books were entirely machine-made, they were often sold "in sheets" (stacks of folded, printed paper) or simply sewn. The buyer would then hire a bookbinder to bind the sheets. Historic book structures generally have the cover attached directly to the textblock by sewing, lacing, or cords.</p>

<p>Following the development of case binding in the 19th century, it became common practice to construct the textblock and covers (case) separately. The textblock is then "cased in," usually by adhering the front and back sheets of the textblock (pastedown) to the insides of the front and back boards. This technique of book production proved conducive to mass production and continues to the present day.</p>

<p>The extensive history of books and their myriad structures are beyond the scope of the PSAP. The most common structures found in library and archive collections are presented here, as well as information about commonly used materials which impact the preservation of books.</p>

<dt>Deterioration</dt>
<dd>
<p>The deterioration of a book (or any bound item) will greatly depend on the materials used to make it, including the cover and binding materials as well as type of paper used for the textblock. The adhesives used may also deteriorate over time and cause the binding to weaken or come apart. Rubber-based and animal hide glues are particularly unstable. Environmental factors such as temperature, relative humidity, and pollutants may result in deterioration of paper and other materials used in the binding. Fluctuating temperature and RH cause paper to swell and contract, which can put stress on the binding and covers. This stress may manifest in the form of cockling, deformed covers, or loose binding. High heat will cause paper to yellow and become brittle, and will accelerate deterioration. An environment with a stable temperature below 65&deg;F and relative humidity between 35&ndash;45% will preserve items and helps prevent pest infestation and mold.</p>


<p>Mold may develop on items stored in a warm, damp environment. Fluctuating temperature and RH may also cause mold to bloom. Mold can leave staining, even when it is no longer active. Pests may leave physical damage or stain cover material and pages (particularly silverfish, cockroaches, and rodents).</p>


<p>Mishandling and heavy use may cause damage or soiling. Common forms of damage due to mishandling include broken hinges, headcaps, and sewing, and damage (folding and tearing) to boards and pages. Book cradles should be available so books are not opened too far, putting stress on the sewn or glued binding.</p>


<p>Foxing is a common form of paper deterioration and is frequently seen in books. Although the exact causes of foxing are varied and not easily identified, but is often the result of fungal growth or metal impurities present in the paper combined with high humidity. Foxing will appear as reddish-brown (rusty) flecks on the paper. They can appear across the surface, or be situated in clusters in "bullseye" (small and round, dark center) or "snowflake" (larger, irregularly shaped blotches) shapes.</p>


<p>Red rot is a type of deterioration particular to leather. It is common in leather bindings produced between the 19th centuries. The exact cause of red rot is unknown, but it is believed to be the result of acidic residue in the leather reacting to poor environmental conditions (pollutants and high heat especially). Red rotted leather is characterized as soft, powdery, crumbling into a reddish brown powder. There is no way to reverse this deterioration, but the leather can be consolidated so it does not crumble further. Consult a conservator before applying consolidants to objects. An alternative treatment, which does not stop the red rot but contains it for easier handling, is to cover the book in a polyethylene sleeve or wrap it in acid-free paper.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Storage Recommendations</dt>
<dd>
<p>Books should be stored upright on the tail edge. They should be gently supported, not tightly crammed onto shelves, and not allowed to slump or sit at an angle. If a book is too tall to fit on the shelf, it should be stored upright on the spine or flat horizontally. A book should never be stored on its fore edge; the weight of the textblock is pulled away from the spine and may cause the hinges to loosen or break.</p>


<p>If possible, books of similar size should be shelved together so that they are equally supported on both sides.</p>


<p>When removing a book from the shelf, grip it on both sides of the spine near the middle of the book and slide it out from the shelf. Do not pull a book from the shelf by the headcap; it may loosen, break, or cause the spine to tear.</p>


<p>Regular housekeeping, including dusting and wiping down shelves as well as collection materials, prevents the accumulation of dirt and debris on and around collection materials as necessary. Dust absorbs and holds moisture, which promotes mold growth, pest damage, and accelerates deterioration.</p>


<p>Dark storage is best if possible, and lights should be turned off in storage areas when patrons and staff are not present. UV filters should be applied on fluorescent light tubes and windows in these areas.</p>


<p>If possible, shelves should not be butted up directly against outside walls and should be placed away from radiators, vents and other areas where temperature and RH fluctuate.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Storage Furniture</dt>
<dd>Store on metal shelves, preferably powder-coated steel or chrome-plated steel shelves and components. Avoid wood. If wood is unavoidable, made certain that it is properly sealed to reduce these gaseous emissions. Avoid oil-based sealants and paints.  Always elect for non-toxic or low VOC (volatile organic compound) sealants/paints, if available.  Recommended sealants include water-based polyurethane or two-part epoxy sealant.</dd>


<dt>Storage Enclosures</dt>
<dd>Valuable or very fragile books may require their own enclosures. This could be as simple as a paper wrapping or as complex as a custom clamshell box depending on the condition and value of the item. Custom boxes may be constructed in-house using archival (acid-free) materials available through many archival supply companies.</dd>

<dt>Display Recommendations</dt>
<dd>Books and pamphlets should be "displayed horizontally or at a gentle angle" (Glaser, n.d.). Do not display an open book beyond its comfort angle, generally 30&ndash;45&deg; (Nicholson, 1992). Anything else may cause warping or weakened binding. Books on display should have their pages turned at regular intervals so to prevent overexposing any single spread to light. Turning the pages also helps prevent damage to the binding from leaving it open at a single point, which puts stress on that part of the spine.</dd>

<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>
<p>Leather was the most common covering material until the 19th century, and continues to be used today. Leather used for books is most often calf, goat, pigskin, sheepskin. Different leathers have varying durability but in terms of preservation should be treated the same. Leather is prepared by removing the hair mechanically or with chemicals, followed by a tanning process. Leather produced through the 16th century is generally stable and often found in good condition due to the slow tanning process which resulted in leather that was resistant to decay and acid deterioration (Ritzenthaler, 2010). As demand for books grew in the 17th century, so too did the demand for leather.</p>
<p>Split leather: Leather, particularly that which is used in bookbinding, has often been split in order to thin the top-grain by separating it from its underside. This "drop split" may be used to produce suede.  Suede is produced from the underside of softer animal skins (lamb, goat, calf) or produced through splitting the hides of thicker cow or deer skins.  As it does not include the exterior skin layer, it is therefore softer (and fuzzy), less durable, and more susceptible to staining and water damage than full-grain leather. Suede was used for books in the 19th century.</p>
<p>Leather from the 19th century will often deteriorate quickly due to the aggressive chemicals used to speed up the tanning process. All leather is inherently acidic, but excessive acidity in combination with exposure to atmospheric pollutants may result in "red rot," a form of leather decomposition that appears soft and will crumble into a reddish-brown powder. Historically, leather dressings have been applied to leather bindings with the intention of preserving the leather’s surface and suppleness. However, recent research may suggest that these dressings likely do not provide any noticeable preservative effect to leather bindings (McCrady, 1993).</p>
<p>Books with slight leather components might be referred to (inaccurately) as "leather bound."  Here are more specific terms regarding the ratio of cover and spine materials: "Full binding" is a term used in which the cover and spine is covered in one material (e.g. leather); "half binding" if a material is split across the spine and only slightly across the sides, at roughly a 1:1 ratio to another material; "quarter binding" if only the spine is covered (1:3).</p>

<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>
<p>Book cloth came into widespread use in the 19th century, c. 1821. Prior to the that, books were primarily bound in leather. An array of fabrics have been used&mdash;particularly earlier in the 19th century&mdash;including silk, velvet, and starch-filled muslin. Cotton and linen have most common, however.  Buckram is a sturdy cotton (or linen) cloth coated and calendared for use as a book cloth. Book cloth may also be embossed with different textures and can be made to imitate the texture of leather. There are three main types of book cloth treatments: starch-filled, pyroxylin-treated, and acrylic-coated.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Starch-filled cloth</strong> originally was a colored and sized muslin. Starch-filled cloth is still in use today and is produced by coating cloth with a slurry of water, starch, clay, and pigment. It is chemically stable but not durable, and is susceptible to insect damage, mold, water spotting, and soiling.</li>
  <li><strong>Pyroxylin-treated cloth</strong> (often buckram) is created with the use of solvents. This process was introduced in the late 19th century. It is durable, though not as chemically stable as starch-filled cloth. It becomes stiff in low temperatures and may become tacky in high temperatures. It may be wiped clean with a damp cloth and is resistant to moisture and insects. Buckram is primarily used as a book covering for circulating library collections and bound journals (library bindings).</li>
  <li><strong>Acrylic-coated cloth</strong> is chemically stable and resistant to moisture, mold, and insects.</li>

<dd>Tawed skin is not tanned, which differentiates it from leather. Tawed skin is usually made of pigskin or goatskin and is preserved using solutions of alum, salt, and sometimes other materials such as egg yolk or flour. The skin is then air dried and flexed over a blade to soften it. The result is a tough, flexible, white skin. It was used most frequently on 17th and 18th century books.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>Sewn (through the fold)</strong> involves sections of pages, called signatures, arranged and sewn together through holes in the folded edges using thread. The sewing is often done over cords or thongs made from animal skins or plant fibers (raised or recessed) or tapes (strips of cloth, vellum, etc.) which are arranged perpendicular to the spine; sewing on cords or tapes provides extra support to the textblock. Raised cords create a decorative element on the spine in the form of raised bands. In the 19th century through the present day it is common for these raised bands to be cosmetic additions and not actually an indication of the sewing structure beneath.  A layer of adhesive is often applied along the spine in addition to the sewing, along with a paper, parchment, or textile spine linings.</p>

<p><strong>Oversewn</strong> (also library binding) binding was sewn done by hand in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and was used for large books and those with loose plates. The oversewing machine came into use in the first quarter of the 20th century. Oversewing is rarely done by hand anymore and is used almost exclusively by library binders. After oversewing, the textblock has about 5/16" removed from the original margin and is tighter in the gutter.</p>

<p><strong>Perfect binding</strong> (also thermoset adhesive) is a type of adhesive binding using a hot melt adhesive applied along the spine to hold the pages of the textblock together. Since this method does not allow the adhesive to penetrate between the sheets, it provides a less secure bond than double fan adhesive. Generally, adhesive bindings are considered inferior to sewn bindings. Adhesive bindings are economical and work well for books that receive heavy use for a short period of time; mass market paperbacks are an example of this binding type.</p>

<p><strong>Double fan adhesive</strong> (DFA) is a type of adhesive binding, usually done with polyvinyl acetate (PVA). The pages of the textblock are fanned out at an angle on the spine-edge of the book, and adhesive is brushed on. The pages are then fanned out in the opposite direction and adhesive applied again. This provides a secure bond between the pages and results in a binding which lies open flat.</p>

<p><strong>Punch-and-bind</strong> (wire binding, comb binding, spiral binding, strip binding, 3-ring binding) involves single sheets being hole-punched or riveted along the spine to allow some form of hardware (e.g. plastic or metal wire, spiral, pins) to hold the textblock together. In the case of a comb binding, a plastic strip with curved prongs secures the sheets through the punched holes. The punch-and-bind method is often used by small organizations as a cheap and easy binding solution for publications, and is also often used to bind reports, proceedings, and manuals. Similar though slightly less popular techniques include coil/spiral binding, ring binding, and strip binding ("VeloBind").</p>
