<h1>Ink and Other Media</h1>
<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Conventional paper documents have two primary elements: a support (paper) and media (ink, graphite, etc.) that "carries" information on that support.  Ink is the most common medium for printed and handwritten documents typically found in archives.  Other handwritten media include graphite (pencil) and wax-based pencil/crayon. The production of some media, either by hand or commercially, dates back several millennia for various writing, drawing, recording, and printing purposes. Characteristics of ink and other media vary depending on their composition and method of formulation. As such, the stability of media has a long-term effect on its paper support, and vice versa.  It should be assumed that all media has potential to fade under extreme light exposure and that ink will bleed or transfer if exposed to moisture.</dd>
  <dt>Components</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Ink and many pencil media are composed of three primary elements: colorants, carriers, and additives.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Colorants</strong> largely determine the color and light sensitivity of the media.  Much of the preservation risk depends on whether it is composed of dye or pigment.  Black has historically been "carbon black," a highly stable pigment derived from elemental carbon.  Any dye color media is at risk of fading on exposure to light; however many modern colors are achieved through pigments.  In general, pigments are preferred because they are more stable, but they are also more expensive and have a more limited color range.</li>
      <li><strong>Carriers</strong> bond the pigment or dye and allow them to be fixed onto the paper surface.  In the past, natural oils or gums would perform this function.  Today synthetic and natural resins are in the mix.  The balance of these compounds will often vary based on the application.  In the case of ink, a carrier/binder substance dictates the ease of flow.</li>
      <li><strong>Additives</strong> are generally used to tweak the performance of the media: to control fluidity, drying time, viscosity, tack, brightness, transparency, etc.</li>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Carbon pigment ink is the earliest type of ink, and can be identified by its deep black color and occasional slight surface sheen. Historically, black pigment has been derived from charcoal (carbonized wood) and later from fine soot (producing a similar ink referred to as lamp black), mixed with a gum arabic or oil carrier. Carbon printing ink is very common in books and text forms (i.e. letterpress, typescript [typewriter ink], and offset lithography).  As it often oil-based, the printed text will often exhibit slight toning beyond its edges ("halo" effect) and/or shadow onto adjacent pages. Good quality carbon inks do not discolor with age, but can smudge in high humidity, as they can be slightly water soluble. Poor quality carbon inks may turn a brown color over time. Additionally, these inks can have flaking problems, especially if they are thickly applied or applied to a polished (highly calendered) paper.</dd>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Iron gall (iron gallotannate) ink was the most predominant type of ink for many centuries as it was inexpensive, could be easily produced at home, and, most significantly, was ideal for use on parchment/vellum. Due to its abundance, iron gall ink was popular with architects, map makers, and artists from the 17th to 19th century. The manufacture of iron gall ink involves mixing tannic acids (oak-tree galls) with vitriol (iron sulfate). Iron gall inks inherently contain sulfuric acid, which can lead to corrosion and disintegration of the support. Likewise, oxidation of the iron compounds present in the ink may lead to ink corrosion, also known as acid hydrolysis. Iron gall ink was also used in copybook applications when mixed with water-soluble dyes (blue aniline dye common after c.1860). These delicate copy papers will be especially susceptible to the effects of corrosion.</dd>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Though typewriter hardware and mechanics has changed considerably over time, the basic principles of ink composition are relatively stable. Black typewriter ribbon ink is very similar to carbon printing ink, though it often includes wax or glycerine additives.  The ribbon ink of the electric typewriter era was slightly different, incorporating myriad combinations of pigments, waxes, and oils.  Colored typewriter inks employ a mix of dye colorants, often with a trace of carbon pigment to enhance opacity. Through the impact of the typewriterâ€™s glyphs, the ink-impregnated ribbon transfers characters to the paper surface.  The ink then dries as it penetrates the paper fibers.  Though the carbon copy process produces a similar typescript, it will be lower contrast and may be erased, as carbon tissue ink merely sits on the copy paper surface.  Processes/formats commonly mistaken for original typewritten documents, other than carbon copies, include: hectographs, stencil copies, typography, and lithography.  The general rule of black ink stability applies to most of these processes.</dd>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Most commercial printing uses pigmented ink colorants in which color is achieved by finely ground pigment particles rather than by the dyes used in writing ink (and most inkjet printing). There are black, white, and colored pigments, comprising organic and inorganic elements, many of which can be blended to achieve a particular ink quality.  Black printing ink is exceptionally stable (see Carbon Black Ink).  White pigment can be opaque or translucent; either is commonly mixed with colored pigment. Though they yield a more muted color range than dyes, the colored pigments are relatively strong, both in terms of light stability and resistance to environmental factors (water exposure, high humidity).</dd>

  <dd>Dye color ink are used primarily in writing instruments, such as ball-point and felt-tip pens; many inkjet printers also use dyed inks.  Synthetic aniline dye emerged in the mid-19th century as a cheap and broadly useful colorant, and was quickly adopted for the letterpress copy process precisely because of its water solubility, allowing transfer from a source letter to its copy paper.  Today, dye inks appear in many modern color pen and marker inks.  The most common issues with dye inks include their poor light stability and their high sensitivity to moisture.  If an object becomes wet or damp, dye color inks can bleed or run.  Many "permanent" pens contain metallized inks (containing iron sulfate, gallic, tannic acids) in addition to dye; these inks are solvent-soluble. In any case, solvents or washing treatments could potentially remove the ink without leaving a trace.  With the aforementioned defects, try to avoid gratuitous light exposure and moisture (high humidity, water).</dd>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>There are two types of felt-tipped pens: water-based and solvent-based. As water and isopropyl alcohol are used to dissolve the dye within, exposure to these substances will cause ink to run and bleed. These pens span a wide spectrum of colors. On the whole, any color, including black, is prone to fading on exposure to light and are inherently acidic. Certain colors are generally more stable, such as yellow, while others, such as pink, purple, violet, and beige, are more sensitive to light.  Many formulations are known to fade even in the dark.  Felt-tipped pens and markers were designed purely for commercial purposes and are not meant to be permanent by any stretch.</dd>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Ball-point pens can appear in a multitude of colors, but are typically black, blue, and red.  The original ball-point was invented and patented in 1888. It was not until the mid-1940s, however, that the improved ball-point pen were widely available. Though the pen have remained virtually unaltered since then, ink composition has changed significantly.  The earliest inks used were viscous, oil-based dye inks that tended to remain sticky on paper. Over time, the proportion of colorants, solvents, and other additives varied in order to improve the ink flow/line quality. Historically, dye has been the preferred colorant as pigment tended to clog the ball-bearing tip and would not easily dissolve in solvents added to hasten drying.  However, modern ball-point inks are quick-dry or glycol-enhanced, and contain soluble dye and/or insoluble pigment colorants. The common weaknesses of ball-point inks are poor light stability and water solubility.  This includes black, which typically fades to blue just as a red will fade to pink. There are few exceptions, so always assume these risks are present: avoid light exposure, moisture (high humidity, water), and solvent treatment.</dd>

  <dd>Pencil graphite is composed of natural carbon and clay. Graphite is a stable, friable medium that is prone to smudging and mechanical abrasion. Depending on the grade (hard to soft) of the graphite, the tone will vary from light gray to black.  The graphite pencil was patented in 1795 by Nicholas-Jacques Conte, who blended clays, graphite and water into a dough that could then be fired and encased in wood. This process is still used today to manufacture graphite pencils. Because of the static charge associated with plastic enclosures, encapsulation is never recommended for friable or loose media, such as graphite and charcoal.</dd>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>First introduced in the 1860s, copying pencils were developed primarily for use with the letterbook and roller copying process. Additionally, copying pencils were marketed for producing a more indelible mark than that of the graphite pencil. The component materials of a copying pencil includes graphite, clay, and a colorant, typically made with aniline dye. Aniline is extremely light sensitive and water-soluble.  Aniline colorants are commonly violet or blue, but may be assumed to be in any color ink for documents and copies produced after the mid-1800s. Visually, it can be very difficult to distinguish between standard graphite pencil and copying pencil markings. The presence of aniline dye in copying pencils, however, indicates that these markings are water and alcohol soluble.</dd>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>The history of wax-based media dates back to the late 18th century, following the invention of the lithographic crayon and the grease pencils. Originally, these pencils were intended for use as a common writing implement. During the 19th century, the use of lithographic crayons and grease pencils shifted when people began utilizing them as a writing and drawing medium. The 19th century development of petroleum-based waxes and oil soluble dyes also spurred the introduction of more versatile and reliable media, including the wax crayon and the colored pencil. Today, the term crayon or colored pencil is ambiguous, referring to any writing/drawing medium in stick form regardless of the nature of its binder.</dd>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Colored pencils are typically wax-based and contain a mixture of colored pigments, additives, and supplementary binding agents.  Lightfastness and chromatic richness have improved over time as high-quality pigments have been introduced in greater concentrations.  Early forms of the colored pencil were available in the early 19th century, though the highly pigmented pencils we are familiar with today did not come about until the 20th century (Ellis & Yeh, 1997), when manufacturers began to produce water-soluble pencils ("watercolor" pencils) and oil-based pencils for artistic application.  These pencils are at greater risk of bleeding, running, and transferring to adjacent materials when exposed to moisture (water, high humidity) and/or solvents.  All colored pencils should be assumed solvent-soluble.  Colored pencil found on archival documents (not artwork) will likely contain lower quality pigment and therefore will be more susceptible to light fading.  Be aware that watercolor pencils, by design, are extremely water-sensitive.  Once on paper, they will appear indistinguishable from water-insoluble pencils until exposed to moisture, which will cause it to feather and bleed wildly.</dd>
