  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>A daguerreotype is a direct positive process with a silver-coated copper plate support and a silver-mercury amalgam image. Image highlight areas are composed of silver-mercury while dark areas remain silver metal. Daguerreotypes are easily identified by a mirror-like, highly polished silver surface and dually negative/positive appearance when viewed from different angles or in raking light.  Daguerreotypes are typically housed in miniature hinged cases made of wood covered with leather, paper, cloth, or mother of pearl. The image may sometimes exhibit subtle dry pigment hand-coloring.</dd>

</dd>
  <dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>The daguerreotype contains the most fragile of all sensitized photo image layers (Hendriks et al., 1991). It is highly susceptible to tarnishing and abrasion since the image material exists only on the outer surface of the plate.  Daguerreotypes should remain enclosed in their original cases or packages to protect the plate’s surface from mechanical damage and atmospheric pollutants.  Tarnishing will result from opening the case packaging or sealer and will begin as a light brown that progresses toward blue-black opaque staining along the the outer edge.  Old cover glasses may also show signs of deterioration in the form of small white spots on the inside surface of the glass.  Daguerreotypes should never be exposed to intense light.</dd>
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd>Moderately high. Care should be taken to protect the object from abrasion, light, atmospheric pollutants, and high humidity. Never remove a daguerreotype from its case before consulting a photo conservator. Careful handling must also be a priority due to the fragility of the cover glass.</dd>
  <dt>Common Size(s)</dt>
  <dd>The sixth-plate is the most popular size, measuring 2¾"  × 3¼" .  Additional sizes include the full plate: 6½"  × 8½" ; half-plate: 4¼"  × 5½" ; quarter-plate: 3¼"  × 4¼" ; ninth-plate: 2"  × 2½" ; Sixteenth-plate: 1⅜"  × 1⅝" .</dd>
  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>Daguerreotypes were produced from 1839 to the 1860s. The process was developed by Louis-Jacques Mandé Daguerre, who discovered how to fix images produced by cameras obscura. Daguerreotypes became a popular means of portraiture, especially by the late 1840s when exposure times were reduced to only a few seconds.  Daguerreotypes were usurped by ambrotypes in the 1850s because they were faster and cheaper to produce.</dd>

Facsimiles or items of low artifactual value may be exhibited for longer periods of time.  Between display periods it should be returned to an appropriate environment where it may "rest"  in dark storage.</p>
    <p>Light levels should be kept as low as possible.  When on display, objects should be protected from exposure to natural light, which contains high levels of UV radiation.

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>An ambrotype is a direct imaging process with a glass support, collodion binder, and silver image.  Ambrotypes are backed with a dark opaque material (e.g. black lacquer, velvet), which makes their negative image appear positive: dark areas appear so because the backing material shows through clear areas in the glass.  Highlights of the image are comprised of silver particle deposits and will appear milky-white.  Image contrast is low; tonal range is limited.  Glass thickness can add a sense of depth to the image.  The image may sometimes be slightly hand-colored.  Like daguerreotypes, ambrotypes are almost exclusively portraiture.  They are typically housed in miniature hinged cases made of wood covered with leather, paper, cloth, or mother of pearl.</dd>

  <dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Ambrotypes may display cracks in what appears to be the image and, in advanced stages, flaking. This is actually the dark varnish used to coat the back of the image emulsion on one side of the glass. As the varnish falls away, it reveals the negative image. This may be caused by a number of issues, but often high humidity and temperature spurs this along.</p>
    <p>Due to their glass support, ambrotypes can sustain severe damage through breakage.  The image surface should never be touched and, similar to daguerreotypes, ambrotypes should remain in their cases or sealed packages to protect them from abrasion and pollutants.  If the image surface is not varnished, the silver image may become oxidized by exposure to air.</p>

  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>Ambrotypes were produced from about 1854 to the 1880s. The process was also known as a collodion positive in Britain but was popularized under the name "ambrotype."   The resulting image of the process involves applying an opaque, dark backing to a glass plate negative so the image appears positive.  Ambrotypes were a popular means of portraiture and were an economical alternative to daguerreotypes, but were largely replaced by tintypes, which were even cheaper, faster, and easier.</dd>

Ambrotypes with flaking emulsion layers should be stored flat. If in a paper sleeve or envelope, position emulsion side away from seams in the enclosures.  Such seams (if any) should be on the sides of the enclosure, not down its center. Wood cabinets should be avoided.  Enameled steel, stainless steel, or anodized aluminum are preferred.

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>A tintype is a direct positive with a lacquered iron support, collodion binder layer, and silver image layer. Tintypes are most commonly found in the carte-de-visite size (approx. 2 ½"  × 4"  to 4 ¼" ), although they were also produced in smaller sizes.  Most tintypes can be thought of as an underexposed image having low contrast and limited tonal range.  The varnished (with black/brown paint, lacquer, or enamel) iron support shows through in dark areas, where silver image particles are few. The image is basically a silver negative set against this background, bringing out highlights comprised of silver particle concentrations that appear milky-white.  Tintypes were occasionally placed in small hinged cases but were more typically inserted into folding cards or envelopes/window mats made of paper or metal; today they will mostly be loose.  Though rare, cased tintypes may be difficult to distinguish from cased ambrotypes.  Weight can help to differentiate, but a magnet may be used to conclusively identify the iron support.</dd>

</dd>
  <dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>The most significant preservation risk to tintypes is exposure to water and high humidity, which will lead to oxidation and rusting.  This in turn will cause blistering, flaking, and total loss of the image emulsion layer.  If placed on a secondary paper support or in a sleeve, rust stains may show on its back side.  A tintype found today will likely be found loose and therefore dented, bent, or scratched up.  The collodion binder and varnishes are sensitive to light and will yellow or perhaps delaminate under intense light exposure.</dd>
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd>Moderate. Tintypes should not be displayed under strong light. They should be stored in envelopes with a piece of archival cardboard inside to prevent deformation and mechanical damage.</dd>
  <dt>Common Size(s)</dt>
  <dd>Varied, sizes listed are approximations.  The sixth-plate (or "bon-ton" ) is the most common, measuring about 2½"  × 3½" .  A quarter-plate is roughly 3¼"  × 4¼" .  Gem tintypes are 1½"  × 1½"  or smaller.  Additional sizes include the ninth-plate: 2"  × 2½" ; half-plate: 4½"  × 5½" ; whole-plate: 6½"  × 8½" .</dd>
  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>Tintypes were commonly produced from 1853 to the 1930s. They are made using a process similar to the ambrotype, but use a lacquered iron support in place of glass with an opaque backing.  Owing to their material resilience and ease of processing, tintypes superseded ambrotypes in the most corners, but were considered lower class photography.   Tintypes were often in use by photographers producing fast, cheap portraits on the street or at public fairs.  Tintypes are most associated with the American Civil War as they were at their most popular during this time and were implemented in documenting battle sites and soldiers.</dd>

<h2 id="19thsupports">Support Materials</h2>
<h3 id="silvercopper">Silver-plated copper</h3>
<p>Daguerreotypes are often misidentified as tintypes due to the fact that they are framed behind glass and the copper support is often concealed by the polished silver sheet.  The copper plate is heavy, usually about 0.4 mm thick and the silver about 0.01 mm.  The image is extremely fragile but the copper support does not factor into this vulnerability.</p>
<h3 id="glass">Glass</h3>
<p>Glass is a transparent support material used for light-sensitive image materials, including the ambrotype.  In general, glass is a very chemically stable support material.  However, any glass plate is vulnerable to severe breakage and cracking.  It has been reported that mild degradation of a glass support may be caused by prolonged exposure to high humidity, resulting in a hazy appearance.  Extreme shifts in temperature could also cause glass to crack.</p>
<h3 id="iron">Lacquered iron</h3>
<p>A lacquered/varnished iron sheet is the primary support material for the tintype (which makes it a misnomer).  A magnet can easily identify the support. Iron corrosion is the main contributor to tintype deterioration.  A humid environment can cause the iron support to rust, which causes the lacquer and overlying emulsion to blister and flake.  The iron sheet itself is often very thin (~0.15 mm) in order to accommodate placement in albums and card displays; when handling a tintype, one should be careful not to bend or scratch either side.</p>
