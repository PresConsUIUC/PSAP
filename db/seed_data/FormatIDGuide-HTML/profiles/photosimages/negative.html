<h1>Negatives</h1>
<p>A negative, of course, contains an inverse image (what is typically dark is light, light is dark). The negative is a semi-transparent image on a transparent support. That support may be either glass or plastic film. Glass negatives are designated as black-and-white, but technically possess a range of subtle tones, depending upon the emulsion binder. As film, still negatives can appear arranged on a film roll or as single image sheets. Silver gelatin film negatives will appear gray-black while chromogenic color negatives comprise complementary colors or will have an overall red-orange mask. The fact that negatives are typically thought of as the original source from which positives and digital scans are best derived should make them high value to your organization.</p>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>An albumen negative is comprised of an albumen and silver emulsion on a glass support.  The image tone ranges from ocher-orange to olive green.  Emulsion will appear creamy in dark areas.  The image resolution is relatively sharp.  Albumen negatives were typically made with thick, irregularly sized rough-cut glass.  Corners may not be coated with emulsion.</dd>

  <dd> A collodion glass negative is comprised of a glass support with a collodion binder and silver image.  The image tone ranges from warm light brown to dark brown when viewed in reflected light.

  <dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>Collodion glass negatives are more sensitive to abrasion than albumen negatives and can be easily scratched.  Due to the glass support they are also vulnerable to breakage.  Collodion glass negatives can develop networks of cracks along the edges of the plate which may lead to image loss.  Glass plate negatives may also exhibit signs of glass deterioration, including a whitish surface haze and/or an efflorescence of viscous droplets (Lavédrine, 2009).</dd>
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd>Moderate. Collodion is chemically unstable and very susceptible to abrasion, though they usually have a varnish or albumen coating which protects the surface.  Do not attempt to clean the emulsion surface.  Should always be protected from excessive humidity. </dd>
  <dt>Common Size(s)</dt>
  <dd>Non-standard plate dimensions vary to extremes. </dd>
  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd> Collodion glass negatives were produced from 1851 to 1885, used primarily by professional photographers.  The wet collodion process was sensitive enough for exposures to be done in only a few seconds, however the plate had to be developed immediately while the collodion was still wet.  Collodion "dry"  plates were created to maintain the plate’s sensitivity over a longer time by adding hygroscopic material.  This dry plate process was also known as the Taupenot process.  The wet collodion process remained more common and was used by some photographers well into the 1880s, even after the emergence of the gelatin dry plate process.</dd>

  <dd>A gelatin glass negative is comprised of a glass support with a gelatin binder and silver image.  Image tones range from neutral gray to black.  Unlike earlier glass plate negatives, gelatin plates were fully coated by emulsion and were cut to standard dimensions, on factory-cut glass less than 2mm thick.  A thin blank strip can be seen near the border.  The gelatin and silver emulsion was applied by machine, resulting in a thin, smooth, even coating which also covered the edges.</dd>

  <dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>Gelatin plates are often found in poor condition.  As with other glass plates, cracks and breakage may occur.  Delamination of the gelatin image-carrying layer is also common and is usually caused either by poor preparation of the glass surface during manufacture or exposure to extreme high and low relative humidity.  Gelatin plates are also susceptible to oxidative deterioration which appears as fading, yellowing, and silver mirroring.  This is often caused by poor storage enclosures such as old cardboard boxes. </dd>
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd> Moderate. Delaminating emulsions can be protected under a plate of glass bound to the original support.  Care should be taken to maintain constant relative humidity to prevent swelling of the gelatin emulsion, which will weaken its attachment to the glass support and cause delamination. </dd>

  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>Gelatin glass negatives were used from 1878 to 1940, used by professional and amateur photographers alike.  Unlike collodion plates, gelatin plates were dry and retained their sensitized state for months.  They could also be developed long after exposure, whereas collodion plates had to be developed immediately.  These advantages allowed for the industrial manufacture and distribution of gelatin plates to a wider public, causing the photographic manufacturing industry to emerge and flourish beginning in the 1880s.</dd>

  <dd> A silver gelatin negative is a negative on a plastic film support (made of cellulose nitrate, cellulose acetate, or polyester) with a gelatin and silver emulsion on the surface that forms the image.  Film is manufactured in standard camera formats and sold as either multiple-image rolls or single-image sheets.  Nitrate film may be identified by "NITRATE"  edge marking, or manufacturer notch codes.  Acetate film may be identified by "SAFETY" edge marking, or manufacturer notch nodes.

  <dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Nitrate:  Cellulose nitrate film deterioration is exacerbated by either a humid or dry environment.  In a humid environment, the emulsion may soften and become sticky.  In a dry environment the film becomes brittle.  In the final stage of deterioration, nitrate film forms a solid mass than cannot be separated or handled safely.  Nitrate film deterioration can be identified by the acrid, sharp odor as nitric and nitrous acids are released.  These acidic vapors are damaging to surrounding objects, so deteriorating film must be evaluated to determine whether it should be discarded.</p>
    <p>Acetate:  Cellulose acetate film is susceptible to vinegar syndrome, causing the film base to shrink and the gelatin emulsion to pull up in folds.  A strong vinegar odor is a telltale symptom in later stages of deterioration. Acetate deterioration is accelerated by humid conditions.</p>
    <p>Polyester:  Polyester film is inert, considered archival and has a life-expectancy of 500+ years under proper storage conditions.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Nitrate: high; Acetate: moderately high; Polyester: low. The silver image on a black-and-white silver gelatin negative is relatively stable.  However, the plastic supports are often unstable and prone to deterioration. </p>
    <p>In the case of nitrate-based film, the preservation risk is very high.  Acetate film is at a moderately high risk level and should be monitored closely for signs of deterioration. Polyester-based film is a low preservation risk.</p>
    <p>Nitrate and acetate film negatives should be stored in dry, cool, well-ventilated areas, and are best stored in envelopes or pockets made of paper with an alkaline reserve.</p>

  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>Silver gelatin negatives were used from 1889 and continue to be used to the present day.  This is the most widely used photographic negative of the 20th century (and its significant presence in most collections will reflect this).  Flexible film began with motion picture photography before being produced for still photography.  Cellulose nitrate sheet film was used from 1889 to 1951, when it was banned due to its flammable properties; acetate "safety"  film from 1925 to the present, but only cellulose triacetate is produced today; polyester film from 1955 to present and is regarded as the only preservation quality base. </dd>

  <dt>Storage Enclosure(s)</dt>
  <dd>Acid-free enclosures and/or folders strongly advised.  Due to cellulose nitrate and acetate’s inherent acidity, storage in a buffered (alkaline) enclosure is recommended.  Each negative should have its own enclosure to protect it from dust, handling damage, and changes in environmental conditions.  This enclosure may be a paper (conservation-quality, acid-free) or plastic (uncoated polyester, polyethylene, polypropylene, cellulose triacetate) sleeve, envelope, or wrapper.  Position photo image material away from seams in paper enclosures.  Such seams (if any) should be on the sides of the enclosure, not down its center. Wood cabinets should be avoided.  Enameled steel, stainless steel, or anodized aluminum are preferred.  All storage materials should pass the Photographic Activity Test (PAT) as specified in ISO Standard 18916:2007.</dd>
  <dt>Storage Orientation</dt>
  <dd> Store vertically with dividers between each negative.  May also be stored horizontally (flat). Roll film is ideally segmented for more uniform, flat storage, but may remain rolled.  Enclosures and folders may be stored in hanging files or archival storage boxes. </dd>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd> Chromogenic process negative is a color image consisting of three gelatin image layers, one on top of the other, atop a plastic film support (acetate or polyester).  From top to bottom the gelatin layers are infused with yellow, magenta, and cyan dye images.  During processing the dye molecules are synthesized.  Film produced after 1947 has a red-orange tint (masking).  Acetate film may be identified by "SAFETY"  edge marking, or manufacturer notch codes.  Polyester film is not usually marked but may bear "Estar"  or "Cronar"  edge markings.</dd>

  <dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Chromogenic negatives will fade, even in dark storage.  Cold storage will slow the rate of deterioration.  Much like chromogenic prints, negatives prior to the 1980s may discolor as a result of severe thermal fading of the cyan dye and poor storage in high temperatures.  Unlike other processes, the progression of color negative stability is linear as coupler staining and dye stability have gradually improved over time.  Deterioration of the film support varies depending on the type of plastic.</p>
    <p>Acetate:  Cellulose acetate film is susceptible to vinegar syndrome, causing the film base to shrink and the gelatin emulsion to pull up in folds.  A strong vinegar odor is a telltale symptom in later stages of deterioration. Acetate deterioration is accelerated by humid conditions.</p>
    <p>Polyester:  Polyester film is inert, considered archival and has a life-expectancy of 500+ years under proper storage conditions.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Acetate: moderately high; Polyester: moderately low.  Chromogenic process negatives image material is especially sensitive to light and humidity, but will gradually deteriorate even under good (dark, dry) storage conditions</p>
    <p>Acetate film is at a moderately high to high risk and should be monitored closely for signs of deterioration.  Polyester film poses less of a risk, but will still suffer from image fading.  Cool and dry storage is advised—cold storage is ideal.</p>

  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd> Chromogenic process negatives were used from 1939 and continue to be used to the present day, but has receded considerably since the proliferation of digital photography.  Agfa debuted the chromogenic negative Agfacolor in 1939.  When Eastman Kodak followed with Kodacolor in 1942, color processes spread in the amateur photo market.  Chromogenic components and dye stability improved over time, most significantly in 1947, when a lack of color saturation was resolved by the addition of red-orange masking.</dd>
