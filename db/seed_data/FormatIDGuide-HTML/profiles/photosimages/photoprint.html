<h1>Photographic Prints</h1>
<p>A photographic image is formed through the exposure of a photosensitive emulsion to light: this is the essence of a photograph. Photo emulsion is composed of a light-sensitive image material (e.g. silver particles) dispersed in a binder substance (e.g. gelatin). The emulsion is carried on a paper or sometimes a plastic support. Photo prints may be monochrome or full-color, and are typically positive images. Monochrome prints are split into three categories: 1-layer (image material only), 2-layer (image material in a binder), or 3-layer (image material in a binder atop a baryta coating).</p>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>A salted paper print is a single-layer print comprised of an uncoated paper support with a silver image deposited in the paper fibers.  A positive print is created by placing a negative in contact with the sensitized silver printing-out paper and exposing it to sunlight.  Paper fibers will be clearly visible.  Many silver salt print images appear to be embedded into the paper surface.  The surface sheen will likely be matte (exhibiting no surface gloss) and its texture rough due to the absence of a binder layer.  If unmounted, the paper will be semi-translucent when viewed over a light source and may in some cases bear a watermark (Stulik &amp; Kaplan, 2013).  The image will likely range from light brown to reddish brown (untoned) to purplish brown (toned). If the print is faded the image may appear yellowish brown.  Typically found mounted, in albums, or loose.</dd>

  <dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>Salted paper prints are sensitive to pollutants, humidity, and light.  Images are often faded and may show pale yellow at their edges.  Highlight details will fade first, but overall fading is also common.  Untoned images will be especially vulnerable to fading.  "Foxing,"  other types of paper staining, and embrittled supports are also common.  If a salt print was retouched, it will now likely appear as a dark spot and may be mistaken as a form of deterioration (Reilly, 1986).</dd>
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd>High. A tendency toward image fading and discoloration will be greatly accelerated by environmental factors such as pollutants (inherent and airborne), high humidity, and light exposure.  If a salt print is untoned, it is of higher priority.</dd>
  <dt>Common Size(s)</dt>
  <dd>Varied; Image dimensions correspond to the process negative</dd>
  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd> Salted paper prints were commonly produced from 1839 to the 1860s.  They were the earliest positive print format and the primary positive process for contact-printing directly from paper negatives and glass negatives (until the 1850s).  Exposure times ranged from a few minutes to a few hours, requiring that the image be visually inspected throughout the process to determine when the exposure was complete.  Before fixing and washing, the image could be toned with gold chloride to increase permanence and create a richer tone.  The comparatively less arduous silver albumen print overtook the silver salt process in the mid-1950s, just before the salt print faded into obscurity in the 1860s.</dd>

  <dd> Acid-free (pH 7.2–9.5) enclosures and/or folders strongly advised (ANSI IT9.2).  Each print should have its own enclosure to protect it from dust, handling damage, and changes in environmental conditions.  This enclosure may be a paper (archival-quality, acid-free) or plastic (uncoated polyester, polyethylene, polypropylene, cellulose triacetate) sleeve, envelope, or wrapper.  Position photo image material away from seams in paper enclosures.  Seams  should be on the sides of the enclosure, not down its center.  Enclosures and folders may be stored in hanging files or archival storage boxes. Wood cabinets should be avoided. Enameled steel, stainless steel, or anodized aluminum are preferred.

  <dd>
    <p>The duration of an exhibit should be determined in advance, and no item should be placed on display permanently.  Most items should not be displayed for longer than 3 to 4 months, assuming other conditions such as light levels, temperature, and relative humidity are within acceptable ranges.  Facsimiles or items of low artifactual value may be exhibited for longer periods of time.  Between display periods it should be returned to an appropriate environment where it may "rest"  in dark storage.</p>
    <p>Light levels should be kept as low as possible.  When on display, objects should be protected from exposure to natural light, which contains high levels of UV radiation.  Shades, curtains, or filters applied directly to windows will help to minimize this exposure.  This is particularly important for salt prints, which are very sensitive to light.</p>
    <p>Display cases should be enclosed and sealed to protect their contents, and items securely framed or matted using preservation-quality materials which have passed the Photographic Activity Test (ISO18916).</p>

  <dd>A cyanotype is a single-layer print comprised of a blue pigment image embedded in an uncoated paper’s fibers.  The image color is a brilliant Prussian blue with continuous tone.  Image is typically of poor contrast and sharpness. The paper fibers are clearly visible and paper texture will likely be rough.  Surface finish is extremely matte with no surface gloss due to the absence of a binder layer. Typically found in albums or loose, the process was used to produce snapshots or blueprints.</dd>

  <dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>Cyanotypes are sensitive to light—will fade quickly in direct, intense light—but are otherwise quite stable if kept in dark storage.  Furthermore, faded cyanotypes can regain substantial image density when kept in dark storage.  As with other early photographic processes, the paper support will often be the weakest link.  Paper staining, discoloration, and embrittlement are common deteriorative traits.</dd>
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd> Moderately low.  Cyanotypes are relatively stable and image permanent if kept in dark storage conditions and out of an alkaline pH environment.  The integrity of the support paper is often the decisive factor in the long term preservation of cyanotypes.</dd>
  <dt>Common Size(s)</dt>
  <dd>Varied; Image dimensions correspond to the process negative</dd>
  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>Cyanotypes were produced from the 1880s to 1950s.  The cyanotype process was invented in 1842 but was not widely used as a photographic print material until the 1880s; popularity waned in the 1910s.  Cyanotypes were most often created by the amateur because of their affordability and simple processing. The cyanotype process has commonly been used to create photograms. The term "blueprint"  generally refers to line drawings reproduced by the cyanotype process for schematic or technical drawings. </dd>

  <dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>Platinum and palladium are the most long-lasting of all chemical photo processes.  The metal image itself is permanent and will exhibit no fading, but the paper support will face a heightened risk of yellowing and embrittlement due to the image’s inherent acidity. The support will have little flexibility; avoid handling prints for this reason.  Deterioration of the paper support will often shift the image toward a warmer tone (evident in highlights).  If the image surface has been stored in contact with another piece of paper, there may be signs of catalytic degradation in the form of a mirror image "burned"  into the facing paper.  This staining is irreversible—do not house platinum prints in direct contact with other photographic materials.</dd>
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd>Low. The integrity of the support paper is the decisive factor in long term preservation; platinum and palladium images are among the most permanent photographic image materials yet pose an enormous threat to its paper support.  Do not allow unnecessary handling and consider creating access copies.</dd>
  <dt>Common Size(s)</dt>
  <dd> Varied; Image dimensions correspond to the process negative</dd>
  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>Platinum prints were produced from 1873 to the late 1930s.  They were expensive to produce and therefore were typically used for high-end portraiture and fine art photography.  Inflation of platinum prices near the turn of the century gave rise to the palladium print, or palladiotype, which simply substitutes metal palladium for platinum.  Palladium prints lack the tonal range of platinum prints, but are otherwise analogous, chemically and visually.</dd>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd> An albumen print is a two-layer print comprised of a paper support with an albumen binder and silver image.  Prints were generally produced on smooth-surfaced thin paper.  Depending on the period, burnishing and rolling techniques may or may not have been implemented to smooth after mounting.  Therefore the surface sheen may range from semi-glossy (1850–c. 1870) to glossy (c. 1870–1895) (Reilly, 1980).  Paper fibers are clearly visible.  The image tone is commonly purplish brown but may vary from warm chocolate brown to yellowish brown (when faded).  Prints after 1855 were always toned with gold chloride. Papers after 1860 may have been tinted with a pink or blue dye in order to mask the natural yellowing of the albumen layer. Typically found mounted, framed, in albums, or loose.  The print’s thin paper support is usually found on a cardstock mount: a carte-de-visite (2½"  × 4¼" ), cabinet card (6¼"  × 4" ), or stereocard (about 3½"  × 7" ).</dd>

  <dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd> Albumen prints will likely exhibit yellowing and some fading.  Most albumen prints exhibit distinct yellow or yellowish brown staining in the non-image and highlight areas (Reilly, 1980).  As the albumen binder tends to yellow, overall print discoloration follows.  Highlights tend to lose image contrast and detail first.  A cracked or crazed pattern may be seen in dark areas, particularly in the case of a thin emulsion coating or an unburnished print.  If the print is unmounted from its cardstock mount it will curl up very tightly.  Some albumen prints will suffer a form of paper staining known as foxing.  Foxing is characterized by the appearance of reddish brown blotches, and will often occur in patches.   If an albumen print was retouched, and it will now likely appear as a dark spot and may be mistaken as a form of deterioration (Reilly, 1986).</dd>
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd>Moderately high.  Albumen prints are sensitive to light, pollutants, and humidity.  High humidity and excessive light exposure will accelerate fading and the deterioration of the albumen binder.  High humidity may also cause foxing to occur. Low humidity will cause albumen to crack and delaminate.  Folds, creases, and general mishandling will also cause cracking and fissuring.</dd>
  <dt>Common Size(s)</dt>
  <dd>Typically mounted on cards.  2½"  × 4" –4¼"  (carte-de-visite);  4¼"  × 6½"  (cabinet card);  3–4½"  × 7"  (stereocard)</dd>
  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd> Albumen prints were produced from 1850 to 1895.   Albumen prints were the dominant print medium for commercial photography between 1860 and the 1890s, replacing daguerreotypes as the prevailing portrait medium.  Albumen carte-de-visite portraits were incredibly popular, allowing people to collect photographs of their family members and prominent public figures alike.  Albumen was gradually superseded by gelatin and collodion printing-out papers around 1885.</dd>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>A carbon print is a two-layer print comprised of a paper support with a carbon black pigment image carried by gelatin.  The surface exhibits differential sheen, with dark areas of the image appearing more glossy than semi-matte highlights.  Thicker application of the pigment/gelatin is relative to the density of the image and will lend toward a subtle relief effect.  Carbon images are recognizable by their dense, dark tones, either neutral black, reddish brown, or chocolate brown, but any pigment color is possible.  Carbon prints may be printed on a variety of colored papers.  The paper fibers are visible in highlights.  The print may be labeled "Permanent"  or "Autotype."  A carbon print and a monochrome carbro print will be indistinguishable; though different processes, each possess the same key elements and a similar image stability. Typically found loose, mounted, framed, or in albums, and may be quite large in size.</dd>

  <dd>A glossy collodion print is a three-layer print comprised of a paper support with a baryta layer, collodion binder, and a silver image.  The surface finish ranges from semi-glossy to glossy due to the thick baryta layer.  Baryta layer may be tinted, exhibiting an overall pink, blue, or green tint.  A collodion print may also have a glazed surface, resulting in a high-gloss finish.  Most glossy collodion prints exhibit a subtle iridescent effect on their surface when viewed under fluorescent lighting.  Image tones range from reddish-brown to purple or violet brown.  Paper fibers will not be visible.   A collodion print may be difficult to distinguish from the gelatin POP; however, it is not often critical to make this distinction. Typically found mounted, framed, in albums, or loose; collodion prints were often produced as cabinet cards.</dd>

  <dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>Collodion prints exhibit very little image fading.  Collodion prints are extremely sensitive to surface abrasion, resulting in white scratch marks where the image material has been removed and the baryta layer is exposed.  This is a distinctive trait of collodion print deterioration. The collodion layer may also delaminate or exhibit tiny cracks due to fluctuating relative humidity and/or mishandling.</dd>
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd> Moderate.  Care must always be shown when handling collodion prints to avoid abrasion, scratching, and surface wear. Do not attempt to clean print surface. A stable environment should also prevent the emulsion from delaminating.</dd>
  <dt>Common Size(s)</dt>
  <dd> Image dimensions will often correspond to gelatin glass plate negatives of the era, though larger sizes are rather rare:  2½" × 2½";  2½" × 4";  4" × 5";  5" × 7";  8" × 10";  11" × 14";  14" × 17";  16" × 20";  18" × 22";  20" × 24"</dd>
  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>Collodion prints were produced from 1880 to 1910, and were conventionally used for portraiture, landscape and architecture photography during that time.  Glossy collodion papers were the first emulsion type printing-out-paper (POP) to be marketed.  Due to the public’s favor for glossy commercial portraiture at the time, collodion POP’s popularity rose quickly in the 1880s, but fell second to the more versatile gelatin POP in the following decade.</dd>

Matte collodion images should be assumed toned and will range in tone from neutral gray-black to a near neutral brownish black to purplish black, and will not appear faded due to the common use of stabilizing toners.  Matte collodion prints were most often toned with gold and platinum, giving them an appearance similar to platinum prints.  Matte collodion are often in the form of cabinet cards or are mounted in a paper folder.</dd>

  <dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>Due to a strong reliance on gold and/or platinum image toning, matte collodion print images are exceptionally stable.  Typically matte collodion have greater stability than the glossy collodion print, exhibiting less fade and silver mirroring, but will slightly fade and yellow over time.  As with all collodion prints, they are sensitive to surface abrasion and may exhibit white scratch marks where the image material has been removed and the baryta layer is exposed.  The collodion layer may also delaminate or exhibit tiny cracks due to fluctuating relative humidity and/or mishandling.</dd>
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd>Moderate. Care must always be shown when handling collodion prints to avoid abrasion, scratching, and surface wear. Do not attempt to clean print surface. Stable humidity should also prevent the emulsion from delaminating.</dd>
  <dt>Common Size(s)</dt>
  <dd>Image dimensions will often correspond to gelatin glass plate negatives of the era:  2½"  × 2½" ;  2½"  × 4" ;  4"  × 5" ;  5"  × 7" ;  8"  × 10" ;  11"  × 14" ;  14"  × 17" ;  16"  × 20" ;  18"  × 22" ;  20"  × 24" </dd>
  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>Matte collodion prints were produced from 1895 to 1910.  Their commercial introduction in the 1890s, and their divergence from the earlier collodion POP print, was based on the public’s preference for both platinum prints and matte surfaced prints in general.  They were meant to mimic the appearance of platinum prints; both were reliant on image toning but matte collodion POP prints were cheaper to produce. Matte collodion paper was the material of choice among portrait photographers until 1910, when more convenient silver gelatin developing out papers emerged.</dd>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>A gelatin POP print is a three-layer print comprised of a paper support with a baryta layer, gelatin binder, and a silver image.  Gelatin POP prints have a matte surface if air-dried, or a glossy surface achieved through ferrotyping (drying the print in contact with a polished metal or glass surface) or burnishing.  Baryta layer may be tinted, exhibiting an overall pink, blue, or green tint.  Image tone will range from reddish-brown (untoned) to purple (toned) or yellow-brown to yellow-green (when faded).  Paper fibers are not visible.  Gelatin POP prints may be difficult to distinguish from collodion prints.  It is not crucial to make this distinction, as generally the only variable that sets each apart is the binder material.  Typically found mounted (as cabinet cards), framed, in an album, or loose.</dd>

</dd>
  <dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>Collodion prints exhibit very little image fading.  Collodion prints are extremely sensitive to surface abrasion, resulting in white scratch marks where the image material has been removed and the baryta layer is exposed.  This is a distinctive trait of collodion print deterioration. The collodion layer may also delaminate or exhibit tiny cracks due to fluctuating relative humidity and/or mishandling.</dd>
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd>Moderate.  Care must always be shown when handling collodion prints to avoid abrasion, scratching, and surface wear. Do not attempt to clean print surface. A stable environment should also prevent the emulsion from delaminating.</dd>
  <dt>Common Size(s)</dt>
  <dd>Image dimensions will often correspond to gelatin glass plate negatives of the era, though larger sizes are rather rare:  2½"  × 2½" ;  2½"  × 4" ;  4"  × 5" ;  5"  × 7" ;  8"  × 10" ;  11"  × 14" ;  14"  × 17" ;  16"  × 20" ;  18"  × 22" ;  20"  × 24" </dd>
  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>Collodion prints were produced from 1880 to 1910, and were conventionally used for portraiture, landscape and architecture photography during that time.  Glossy collodion papers were the first emulsion type printing-out-paper (POP) to be marketed.  Due to the public’s favor for glossy commercial portraiture at the time, collodion POP’s popularity rose quickly in the 1880s, but fell second to the more versatile gelatin POP in the following decade.</dd>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>A silver gelatin print is a three-layer print comprised of a paper support with a baryta or resin coating, a gelatin binder, and a silver image.  Prints are made using a light-sensitive gelatin silver bromide or gelatin silver chloride paper, and a negative.  The surface sheen may be matte, glossy, or specially textured.  In most cases, no paper fibers are visible, obscured behind a thick baryta layer (on fiber-based paper) or a pigmented polyethylene layer (resin-coated paper; after 1968) though the earliest papers (prior to 1900) may have a thin baryta layer.  Resin-coated prints can be identified by their smooth, plasticized back side.  The untoned print image will be neutral gray-black (unless severely deteriorated).  Many were toned, however, and typically appear within the range of brown or sepia, but yellowish and purplish tones are also common. Silver gelatin photo postcards (c. 1900–1940s) can be identified by their continuous tone image (unlike photomechanical postcards) and postal back printing.  Silver gelatin prints are typically found mounted, framed, in albums, or loose.</dd>

  <dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>Silver gelatin images often exhibit silver mirroring due to oxidation, causing the silver particles to rise to the top of the gelatin layer; this is typically more acute along the edges and in darker areas of the image.  Image fading is first and most apparent in highlights.  Discoloration (yellow-brown) and fading in highlights, at edges, or across the image is often a symptom of air pollutants or poor storage materials.  Resin-coated silver gelatin prints are exclusively susceptible to redox blemishing, which appear as small orange-yellow spots in the image.  Fiber-based prints will have a tendency to curl, usually as a result of fluctuating humidity.</dd>
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd>Fiber-based: Moderately low.  Resin-coated: Moderate.  Exposure to air pollutants is often the significant prolonged threat to silver image materials, but warm and humid environments will only accelerate the destructive effects.  RC prints’ surfaces may stick to one another under extreme heat.  RC prints are also more susceptible to light damage than fiber-based.</dd>

  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>Silver gelatin prints have been in common use from 1880 to today, though have ebbed since the rise of digital photography; silver gelatin prints were the dominant black-and-white photographic process of the twentieth century (their sizable presence in most collections will reflect this).  Unlike the printing-out process, which allowed exposure to be monitored as an image gradually appeared, the developing-out process required a "light-tight"  room and precise exposure times.  The process was used widely and made new forms of industrial printing possible.  Silver gelatin photographic postcards were common from about 1900 through the 1920s, and may feature families, local athletes, and worldwide celebrities alike.  Resin-coated papers were introduced in 1968 and by the early 1970s accounted for about 70% of the photographic paper market share (Funderburk, 2009). </dd>

  <dt>Backprinting</dt>
  <dd>Manufacturer backprints will often help to both identify the format as well as to determine the time period.  Common Kodak backprinting will include "Velox"  (late 1920s–c. 1950s), "Kodak / Velox / Paper"  (c. 1950–mid-1960s), "A Kodak Paper"  (1960s–early 1970s), and "THIS PAPER / MANUFACTURED / BY KODAK"  (1970s–1980s).  The absence of backprints should not definitively rule out a format or period.  Agfa photo paper clues, however, are consistent.  Before the late 1950s, "Agfa"   followed by the brand name (e.g. "Agfa Lupex" ).  After the late 1950s, brand names were dropped and backprints simply read "Agfa"  (Messier, 2005).</dd>

Chromogenic prints often will be identifiable by the manufacturer’s print on the back of the support paper (backprint), or a stamp on the back applied by the photo-processor (back stamp).  Information about the process, date, and materials used are usually included in these stamps. White borders will appear on fiber-based prints, but were abandoned with RC prints.

  <dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd> Chromogenic color prints are extremely sensitive to light and humidity, and will exhibit some dye fading even if kept in dark, cold storage.  Early chromogenic prints from before the 1980s are especially prone to coupler staining due to dye instability. Staining is a typical form of deterioration caused by light exposure and inherent coupler print-out, identified by yellow staining due to magenta dye fading/absence.  This is most apparent in highlights and borders.  Prints created before the 1980s may have reddish image discoloration as a result of the unstable cyan dye’s severe thermal fading and poor storage in high temperatures.  Unlike other photographs, the progressive improvement of color print stability is linear as coupler staining and dye stability have gradually improved over time (Reilly, 1998).</dd>
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd>Moderately high. Chromogenic prints are extremely sensitive to light and humidity.  They should be stored in a cool, dark environment in order to slow dye fading, though cold storage is ideal. A chromogenic print produced prior to the mid-1980s will invariably lose its image in time, even in dark storage.</dd>

  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>Kodak introduced Kodacolor, the first consumer "snapshot"  quality positive (and negative) color print (on paper) process, in 1942.  Though popular, chromogenic prints faded and discolored quickly due to unstable dye couplers.  By the mid-1960s, many of the challenges to dye stability and print quality were resolved and chromogenic prints overtook black-and-white across the amateur market (Weaver &amp; Long, 2009).  Fiber-based papers (with baryta brightener) were produced from 1942 to 1971.  Resin-coated (RC) papers (polyethylene w/ titanium dioxide brightener) were produced from 1968 to the present day.</dd>

  <dt>Storage Enclosure(s)</dt>
  <dd>Acid-free (pH 7.2–9.5) enclosures and/or folders strongly advised (ANSI IT9.2).  Each print should have its own enclosure to protect it from dust, handling damage, and changes in environmental conditions.  This enclosure may be a  paper (archival-quality, acid-free) or plastic (uncoated polyester, polyethylene, polypropylene, cellulose triacetate) sleeve, envelope, or wrapper.  Position photo image material away from seams in paper enclosures.  Seams should be on the sides of the enclosure, not down its center.  Enclosures and folders may be stored in hanging files or archival storage boxes. Wood cabinets should be avoided. Enameled steel, stainless steel, or anodized aluminum are preferred.  All storage materials should pass the Photographic Activity Test (PAT) as specified in ISO Standard 18916:2007.</dd>
  <dt>Storage Orientation</dt>

  <dt>Display Recommendations</dt>
  <dd>
    <p> Light exposure should be limited.  This is especially true of the early prints (pre-1965).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Other Chromogenic Formations</dt>
  <dd>
    <p> There were many forms of the color print that failed to take off, including some that will appear to be chromogenic color prints as profiled in this description.  Be aware that some structural variations of the dye coupler print exist.</p>
    <p>Polyester supports (1979–present):  A few contemporary Fuji and Ilford formats, and Kodak Endura Display.  An extremely glossy surface will make them appear similar to a silver dye-bleach print.  There will also be no backprint.</p>
    <p>Acetate supports (1941–1981):  Kodak’s Minicolor (wallet-sized; renamed Kodachrome Print) and Kotavachrome (large-scale professional format; renamed Kodachrome Professional Print).  Both were on a white-pigmented acetate support, but were otherwise structurally identical to chromogenic prints.  Both were introduced in 1941, a year before Kodachrome, and were available until the mid-1950s.  More obscure formats persisted until the early 1980s.</p>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>A silver dye-bleach print is a three-layer "full-color"  print comprised of a polyester, pigmented acetate, or RC paper support and an image made up of three gelatin layers, each containing an azo dye image: cyan, magenta, and yellow.  The three silver bromide gelatin emulsion layers are each sensitized to a different spectral region.  After the paper is exposed using a positive color transparency, it is developed and then bleached, selectively destroying pre-formed dyes.  The dye molecules remaining after the image has been developed and bleached constitute the direct positive image from the positive transparency used during the exposure. The silver dye image has vivid colors, high contrast, and minimal fading. The surface may be either a semi-gloss ("Pearl" ) or high-gloss finish, with a metallic-like finish.  The support may also be an indicator, whether plastic (acetate or polyester) or RC paper.  RC paper will have a manufacturer’s backprint while plastic likely will not.  In some cases, there may also be a black margin around the image.</dd>

  <dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>Silver dye-bleach prints are highly sensitive to water, pollutants, abrasion, and fingerprints.  Wetting may cause distortion, delamination, and dye migration.  Because silver dye-bleach prints are produced using azo dyes, which are relatively light stable, image quality is high and will exhibit little to no image fading.  Polyester supports have strength and provide excellent image stability. RC supports curl and will embrittle and crack due to light exposure and fluctuating RH. Acetate supports will yellow and eventually exhibit vinegar syndrome.  However, long term display should be avoided as prolonged light exposure and airborne pollutants will cause color to shift. </dd>
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd>Moderately low. Silver dye-bleach prints have superior stability in dark storage, considered to be "essentially permanent in dark keeping"  (Wilhelm, 1978).  This, of course, supposes that the print is on a polyester support, instead of the rarer acetate or RC paper support.  If on RC paper or acetate, support instability will be the weakest link in terms of photographic permanence.  Polyester supports are low risk and quite stable. Care should be taken when handling prints to avoid abrading or placing fingerprints on the glossy surface. Very humid or wet environments may cause considerable deformation and delamination.</dd>
  <dt>Common Size(s)</dt>
  <dd>Varied; medium and large format prints (due to enlargement) are common</dd>
  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd> Silver dye-bleach prints were produced from 1963 to c. 2011.  The Cibachrome process was based on a color motion film process called Gasparcolor, developed by Bela Gaspar in 1933.  Ciba-Geigy released the modern version of this process, first under Pigmented acetate supports were used until the late 1970s, when polyester and resin-coated papers were introduced the name Cilchrome and then Cibachrome, in 1963.     Ciba acquired Ilford in 1967 and championed the process throughout the next two decades before selling it to International Paper Corp in 1989.  The product was then renamed Ilfochrome (1991). Silver dye-bleach prints are noted for their high image quality and permanence, making them a popular choice for those creating fine art prints.  Ilford ceased production of Ilfochrome products and processing chemicals in 2011.</dd>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>A dye-transfer print is a three-layer print comprised of a paper support with a baryta layer, and an image made up of yellow, magenta, and cyan dyes held in a single gelatin layer.  A dye-transfer print may be identified by misalignment of the color dye layers, mainly visible along the edges of high and low density areas.  Similarly, under magnification, the image details will appear soft and there will be no discernible color particles. The non-image margins may also have dye stains.  When viewed under UV light, the magenta dye fluoresces orange.  Dye-transfer prints were for some time the only color print process with a fiber-base support and may be identified as such.  The baryta layer is very thick, which obscures all evidence of paper fibers.  The surface is smooth, showing no relief or differential sheen.  Dye-transfer prints will most likely be clearly identifiable as studio or high-end production photography. </dd>

  <dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>Dye-transfer prints are sensitive to light and water.  If they are protected from prolonged exposure to light, ideally in a dark, low humidity storage environment, dye-transfer prints will maintain excellent image stability and exhibit little dye fading and no discoloration.  On the whole, dye-transfer will display little to no image fading.  Yellow or magenta dye bleeding may be a result of water exposure.</dd>
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd>Moderately low. "They are more stable in dark storage that any other Kodak color print process.  They will almost certainly last more than 100 years with no significant change if kept in the dark except for occasional viewing or short-term display"  (Wilhelm, 1978). Dye-transfer prints should not be stored in humid environments or exposed to intense light for prolonged periods.  Wetting the print surface may cause the dyes to bleed or run.</dd>

  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>Dye-transfer prints were produced from c. 1940 to c. 1993.  Kodak’s Wash-Off Relief Process was released in 1935, and was improved and renamed as the Original Kodak Dye Transfer Process in 1946.  Dye-transfer printing is a highly complex process that in its day allowed unparalleled control over color levels and development.  It was expensive and difficult to master, existing primarily in the domain of professional labs.  Perfectly-registered prints were difficult to achieve by those who were not expert technicians.  Dye-transfer was touted as the preferred color print process for artists and collectors because of this control, and the permanence of the image.  Eastman Kodak ceased production of dye-transfer materials in 1994, essentially ending the widespread use of this process.</dd>

  <dt>About the Process</dt>
  <dd> Although dye-transfer prints are considered photographic images, they are not the result of direct exposure to light.  Rather, they are created by a series of dye layers applied using special dye-transfer matrix film.  Each matrix film (one for each dye color) used to create the print has a gelatin layer which varies in thickness according to the image density.  This in turn controls how much dye is picked up by those areas of the gelatin when the matrix film is submerged in the dye solution.  Each color layer is transferred to the print surface by bringing the matrix film in contact with the paper surface. </dd>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd> A carbro print is a three-layer print comprised of a paper support, and image made up of three pigmented gelatin layers.  Carbro printing is a tri-color variation of the carbon pigment printing process.  Each gelatin layer is printed from a B&amp;W negative produced through a colored filter.  After the layers have been processed, they are superimposed on a paper support to create a 3-color image.  Print surface will exhibit a differential gloss as a result of the thicker pigmented gelatin in dense areas and thinner gelatin in light areas.  Darker areas are glossy while highlights have a semi-matte surface finish.  This disparity is especially apparent between high- and low-density image areas.  Color layers will often seem misaligned or separated, particularly at borders and in areas of fine detail.  Another printing flaw/clue is the wrinkling, creasing, or frilling of gelatin-pigment layers.  Pigment particles can be seen throughout the image under low magnification. Carbro prints are known for their vivid 3-color values and image permanence, and are synonymous with color magazines and advertising imagery of the era.</dd>

</dd>
  <dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>Since the pigments used to form carbro print images are particularly stable, carbro prints show little to no image fading and no yellowing.  Unstable environmental conditions, especially low relative humidity, may cause the pigmented gelatin layers to delaminate or crack, especially in dark areas, where the gelatin is thicker.  Carbro prints are also sensitive to abrasions, scratches, and general physical damage. </dd>
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd>Moderately low. As carbro prints contain pigment rather than silver or other unstable components, the integrity of the support paper is the decisive factor in the object’s permanence, as well as the item’s display and storage history. Carbro prints should not be stored in excessively dry storage conditions, in order to avoid delamination or cracking of the pigmented gelatin layers. </dd>

  <dd>Varied; Image dimensions correspond to the process negative</dd>
  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>Carbro prints were produced from the early 1900s to 1950.  Carbro was the standard process for high-end advertising, particularly in fashion magazines, until the 1950s when the less expensive and more flexible dye-transfer process won over these publishers.  The Autotype Company produced carbro materials until 1953, but remained available until the 1960s.  The Vivex color process, produced from 1931 to 1939 (stalled by WWII), was a commercial printing process based on the tri-color carbro. </dd>

  <dd> A black-and-white (B&amp;W) instant photo is comprised of a paper or plastic (rare) support, gelatin binder, and silver image.  The image is produced by an alkaline induced dye diffusion transfer process.  B&amp;W instant photos are generally of the peel-apart variety; B&amp;W integral photos do exist (Polaroid type 600), but are rare (see <a href="#instantfilms">Instant Film</a> notes).  All the chemicals necessary to create the print are self-contained within or facing the support material and are activated when the exposure is made and the image is squeezed through rollers ejecting it from the camera.  The surface sheen will be glossy.  The most common format dimensions are 3 ¼"  × 4 ¼"  and 2 ½"  × 3 ¼"  (Polaroid roll film, with perforated edges).  Polaroid prints after 1968 will feature a manufacturer's stamp identifying the film type and manufacturing date in alphanumeric code. Polaroid did not produce a B&amp;W film other than those that required the protective polymer coater until 1970.</dd>

  <dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>Sensitivity to abrasion and environmental pollutants depends on how the print was produced.  Generally, B&amp;W instant photos commonly fade around the edges and develop discolored patches throughout the print.  Properly coated peel-apart prints are resistant to abrasion, but more susceptible to chemical contaminants.  B&amp;W photos manufactured by Polaroid before 1970 required the print to be hand-coated with a protective polymer.  If applied unevenly, uncoated areas may develop yellowing, loss of detail, and increased sensitivity to abrasion.  The white border found around instant photos should never be cut off or removed; it provides a barrier to atmospheric pollutants and removal would also weaken the structural integrity of the photograph.  Unmounted prints may curl.</dd>
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd>Moderate. The absolute uniqueness of the item/image should factor in an instant print’s value appraisal and preservation. Preservation risk largely depends on whether the image was produced according to the film specifications (e.g. whether processing chemicals have been neutralized, whether a protective coating was correctly applied), and the type of film (peel-apart, coated peel-apart, or integral). On the whole, B&amp;W instant photos are more stable than color instant photos, but as with all silver-based photographs, they are susceptible to light fading and oxidative deterioration.</dd>

  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>B&amp;W instant photos were produced from 1947 through the late 2000s.  The instant photographic process was developed by Edwin Land, one of the cofounders of the Polaroid Corporation, who sought to create a photographic process that did not require a darkroom.  He believed there would be a large market for photographs that could be exposed and developed immediately.  Polaroid was the first to manufacture instant photographic film and cameras, with the release of the Land Camera in 1947.  Instant photos were popular among a wide range of consumers and used for many applications, from spontaneous family snapshots, to test shots made by professional photographers, to original fine art prints created by artists.  After the end of Polaroid’s instant film production in 2008, The Impossible Project began the manufacture of instant photo products in 2010, but in limited, boutique numbers.</dd>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>A color instant photo is comprised of a plastic support, gelatin binder, and silver and dye image.  The image is created through a silver assisted dye diffusion transfer process.    Color instant photos may be either peel-apart or integral (see <a href="#instantfilms">Instant Film</a> notes).  Instant photos have a very glossy surface finish.  The most common format dimensions are 3¼"  × 4¼"  (peel-apart), 3¼"  × 3⅜"  (peel-apart), and 3½"  × 4¼"  (integral).  The integral format in particular can be easily identified by their unproportional border, with the lower white border larger than the others to house the chemical pods used to process and create the image.  Peel-apart film was often packaged with self-adhesive mounts.  Polaroid prints after 1968 will feature a manufacturer's stamp identifying the film type and manufacturing date in alphanumeric code.  Early peel-apart Polaroid photos may be attached to self-adhesive mounts, with or without the Polaroid logo printed on the back.</dd>

  <dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>Color shifting and fading is inevitable.  Levels of sensitivity to abrasion and environmental pollutants will depend on film type.  Peel-apart types will be resistant to abrasion, but more susceptible to chemical contaminants.  Integral types are more prone to yellowish staining and fading, especially Polaroid SX-70 from the 1970s and 1980s.  Instant photos manufactured before 1976 may also exhibit cracking in the image receiving layer (beneath the transparent print cover sheet) (Pénichon, 2013).  All instant photographs are very sensitive to light and have poor light fading stability.  Certain brands have poorer stability than others, with Kodak PR-10 instant prints among the least stable (Wilhelm, 1993, p. 31).  The white border found around many instant photographs should never be cut, punctured, or removed; it provides a barrier to atmospheric pollutants and removal would weaken the structural integrity of the photo.  Peel-apart photos also have a tendency to curl.</dd>
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd>High (integral) to moderate (peel-apart). The absolute uniqueness of the item should factor in an instant print’s appraisal and preservation. Preservation risk largely depends on whether the image was produced according to the film specifications, and the type of film (peel-apart or integral).  Like most color processes, color instant prints are very sensitive to light and should be kept in temperate, dark storage.</dd>

  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>Color instant photos were produced from 1963 to 2008.  Polaroid Polacolor film was introduced in 1963 and the ubiquitous SX-70 integral film in 1972.  The integral SX-70 film was designed for use by amateurs, and dominated the instant film market for decades.  In 1981 Polaroid released type 600 integral film: an improved, faster-forming emulsion.  Polaroid made instant color film in a number of sizes, including very large film (20"  × 24" ). Integral film packs like the SX-70, 600, and 700 remained available until 2008, when Polaroid ceased production.  Film type 100, a peel-apart film, was also discontinued by Polaroid in 2008, though it is still produced by Fujifilm. Kodak followed Polaroid in 1976 with the release of its own integral film, Instant Print Film PR-10.  Kodak eventually lost a patent infringement lawsuit initiated by Polaroid, resulting in the withdrawal of its instant films and cameras from the market in 1986.  After the end of Polaroid instant film production in 2008, The Impossible Project began the manufacture of instant photo products in 2010, but in limited boutique numbers.</dd>

  <dt>Storage Enclosure(s)</dt>
  <dd>Store instant prints/films away from other photographs due to the escape of chemicals and sharp, sturdy corners with an ability to damage adjacent photos.  Store integral prints on their sides rather than on end so to prevent dye migration.  Acidic and high-alkaline enclosures and/or folders should be avoided.  Materials with a pH of 7.0 to 8.5 are recommended.  Each print should have its own enclosure to protect it from dust, handling damage, and changes in environmental conditions.  This enclosure may be a paper (archival quality) or plastic (uncoated polyester, polyethylene, polypropylene, cellulose triacetate) sleeve, envelope, or wrapper.  Paper enclosure seams should be along the sides, not down its center.  Enclosures and folders may be stored in hanging files or archival storage boxes. Wood cabinets should be avoided. Enameled steel, stainless steel, or anodized aluminum are preferred.  All storage materials should pass the Photographic Activity Test (PAT) as specified in ISO Standard 18916:2007.</dd>
  <dt>Storage Orientation</dt>
  <dd>Store vertically with dividers between each print.  May also be stored horizontally, especially large prints.  Avoid folding and rolling large formats.  Enclosures and folders may be stored in hanging files or archival storage boxes. </dd>

<h2 id="photoprintlayers">Monochrome Print Layers</h2>
<p>Photo emulsion is composed of a light-sensitive image material (e.g. silver particles) dispersed in a binder substance (e.g. gelatin). The emulsion is carried on a paper or sometimes a plastic support. Monochrome photographic prints are split into the following three categories popularized by James Reilly: 1-layer (image material only), 2-layer (image material in a binder), or 3-layer (image material in a binder atop a baryta coating).</p>

</div>
<p>"Card photograph" broadly refers to any of the standard-sized commercially produced photograph card mounts of the 19th century.  Of these secondary supports, the carte-de-visite, cabinet card, and stereocard are the most common.  Other card photographs include the Trilby (2" × 2 ¾"), Victoria (5" × 3¼"), Promenade (7" × 4"), Boudoir (8½" × 5¼"), and Imperial (7" × 10").</p>
<h3>Carte-de-visite</h3>
<div class="figure-gallery">
  <figure><img src="images/cdv-sojournertruth.jpg" alt="Carde de visite photograph" data-has-retina="true"><figcaption>A carte-de-visite measures approximately 4 ¼" × 2 ½" (11.4 × 6.4 cm). Image by unknown photographer, original publisher Sojourner Truth, available in the public domain: Gladstone Collection, Prints and Photographs Division, Library of Congress; Reproduction Number: LC-USZC4-6165 (3-11b). </figcaption></figure>
</div>
<p>A very popular form of portraiture display, the carte-de-visite most often contained an albumen print, though occasionally a carbon print, of nearly the same size.  The carte-de-visite is considered a relatively small-sized card photograph.  The paper cardstock mount measures approximately 4 ¼" × 2 ½" (11.4 × 6.4 cm).  Usually full-length studio portraiture, carte-de-visites were collected in albums; celebrities’ portraits, scenic views, and art reproductions were common subjects.  The back print will typically bear the photographer’s name and studio address.  Introduced in the late 1850s, cartes-de-visite were produced in the millions during the 1860s.  By 1880 they were less common than the cabinet card but were sometimes used to display a silver gelatin print.</p>
<h3>Cabinet card</h3>
<div class="figure-gallery">

</div>
<p>Typically a form of portraiture display, the mid-sized cabinet photograph was larger in scale than the carte-de-visite, which predated it.  A cabinet card was a thick paper cardstock measuring about 6 ¼" × 4 ¼" (15.9 × 10.8 cm) usually framing an albumen print (occasionally later forms could be silver gelatin, collodion, platinum, or carbon print) measuring about 5 ½" × 4" (13.9 × 10 cm).  The lower border of the card usually bore the photographer’s name or studio insignia, and occasionally the subject’s name. The cabinet photo display was popular from 1868 through the 1890s, as scenic view postcards and enlarged studio portraits rose in public favor.</p>
<h3>Stereocard</h3>
<div class="figure-gallery">
  <figure><img src="images/albumen_stereoview3_a.jpg" alt="Stereocard albumen print" data-has-retina="true"><figcaption>Stereocard. Albumen prints mounted on a stereocard.</figcaption></figure>
</div>
<p>A stereocard photograph (synonyms: stereoview; stereograph) is intended to create three-dimensional images with the illusion of depth by emulating the stereoscopic nature of human vision. Stereocards are made up of two images, produced using a special camera with two lenses eye-width apart.  This results in two images that are almost identical but are taken from slightly different viewpoints—approximating the different viewpoints seen from the left and right eyes.  The images were mounted on a card (3–4½" × 7") next to one another.  Cards could be viewed using a special hand-held viewer (stereoscope) that forced each eye to see only the image associated with it.  Stereocards were popular from the 1850s to 1920s.  The earliest stereographic images were daguerreotypes, but stereocards prior to the 1880s were usually albumen prints.  Gelatin prints were dominant after the 1880s.  Some stereo-pictures, printed on very thin paper, that were hand-colored (with water colors or aniline dyes) on front and back were meant for viewing through light, were called "cosmoramas."  Stereocards were popular among tourists and were frequently produced by locals in vacation destinations.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="binders">Binder Materials</h2>
<p>When we talk about the binder layer we are talking about the layer that suspends the photographically sensitive material.  In the case of silver gelatin processes, gelatin binds the evenly-dispersed silver particle image into what is in total called the emulsion.</p>
<h3>Gelatin</h3>
<p>Gelatin is the most common binder in 20th century photo emulsions; it is a refined extract from animal wastes (i.e. bones, hoofs, hides).  Because of this, gelatin will absorb moisture and accelerates chemical deterioration under humid conditions. Exposure to water and high humidity will cause gelatin to expand and soften.  Due to their organic composition, gelatin emulsions are subject to biological deterioration, pest damage, and mold attack.</p>
<p>Gelatin blistering and frilling are two forms of nearly the same type of deterioration caused by cycling environments.  Blistering happens when the gelatin emulsion bubbles or lifts from the support in localized spots; frilling occurs when the gelatin lifts in larger sections and appears to ruffle at the edges.</p>
<h3>Collodion</h3>
<p>Collodion is a synthetic material produced by the chemical reaction of pure cellulose with nitric acid; the collodion binder is essentially cellulose nitrate, a plastic film that is not sensitive to moisture.  RH and biological deterioration are less of a concern here than with other binders.  High temperature and low RH can, however, lend toward embrittlement and cracking of the binder, which is the most significant threat to a collodion emulsion.  It is also very sensitive to abrasion, so much so that small scratches are often an identifying trait.</p>
<p>Collodion on paper is less of a factor in image deterioration than gelatin or albumen, but collodion on glass can exhibit slight blistering and frilling, caused by cycling environments.  Blistering happens when the binder bubbles or lifts from the support in localized spots; frilling occurs when the binder lifts in larger sections and appears to ruffle at its edges.</p>
<h3>Albumen</h3>
<p>Albumen is a denatured protein: chicken egg white with salt.  This solution would be evenly coated on a sheet of paper, dried, and then sensitized in a silver nitrate solution.  Despite the main ingredient, albumen is not subject to pest or microorganism damage like gelatin.  The primary and most obvious forms of albumen deterioration are the yellowing of image highlights and borders.  Image fading will often cause shadow density to discolor toward yellow brown and lose details.  Because it is denatured, albumen is not susceptible to damage as a result of moisture and humidity like gelatin.  However, albumen emulsions (especially when mounted) will form tiny networks of cracks and fissures over the whole image.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="photopapercoat">Photo Paper Coatings</h2>
<p>Regardless of the coating, paper fibers will not be fully visible, as they are obscured behind baryta (on fiber-based papers) or a whitener under a resin coating (on resin-coated papers). Before coatings were adopted (late-19th century), impurities from the paper would spread to the image and cause severe fading and discoloration. Papers coatings serve as buffers to the image material, among other things.</p>
<p>The earliest baryta papers may be have a thin or uneven coatings. In those cases, fibers may be evident.  Resin-coated prints are easily identified by their smooth, plasticized back sides.</p>
<h3>Baryta (1890s–present; decline after 1960s)</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>A baryta layer is commonly found on fiber-based photo papers (as opposed to resin-coated papers). Baryta is an opaque surface coating on the paper support and below the image emulsion layer. The primary purpose of this white pigment layer (barium sulfate dispersed in gelatin) is to provide a smooth and evenly white surface over the paper fibers (though sometimes other textures were created). Additionally, baryta limits the penetration of the binder and/or image materials into the fibers and engenders more even tonalities in the image. The thicker the application of baryta, the smoother and less visible underlying paper fibers appear. The earliest papers (prior to 1900) may have a thin, uneven baryta layer or even none at all. In any case, looking at the trimmed (or dented) edges of the paper under low magnification can reveal exposed underlying fibers.</dd>
  <dt>Stability</dt>
  <dd>Baryta, on the whole, has proven to be stable over time. Since the 1950s, optical brightening agents have been incorporated into the whitening agent, along with a number of other additives that have proven both good and bad for the chemical stability of the image. Baryta persists–albeit slightly reformulated–used in some inkjet photo papers today.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Resin-coated (RC) paper (1968–present)</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Polyethylene resin-coated paper, or "RC"  paper, was meant to reduce the amount of moisture absorbed by the photo paper support.  RC Paper was typically used for wet process chromogenic color prints and gelatin silver prints, though also for inkjet and other digital print processes simply to imitate the look and feel of photographic papers. The benefit of RC paper was faster processing due to reduced washing and drying times.  The plastic laminate was also meant to lessen print curl and drying cockle that afflicted fiber-based photo papers after wet processing.  The image side layer of laminate was often pigmented white (with titanium dioxide particles) to make the image bright.</dd>
  <dt>Prevalence</dt>
  <dd>"[T]he rapidly increasing demand for color products outpaced all of the products and the growth of resin coated papers for many products meant that by the early 1970s about 70% of the products were resin coated rather than baryta coated"  (Funderburk, 2009).</dd>
  <dt>Stability</dt>
  <dd>Early inclusion of titanium dioxide (as a whitener) in the RC formula led to destructive embrittlement and cracking of the emulsion side polyethylene layer (from 1968–c. 1980).  Exposure to light would hasten the negative impact of this flaw.  The titanium dioxide, upon exposure to light, would release oxygen.  Oxygen attacked the polyethylene, making it brittle.  Embrittlement coupled with fluctuating RH would then cause it to crack and flake.  By the late 1970s, manufacturers worked to resolve this issue by substituting a less reactive titanium dioxide formula.</dd>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>B&amp;W (1948–present) or Color (1963–present). Polaroid’s Polacolor color process debuted with a fairly unsaturated dye composition, due to unstable yellow and magenta dyes. Polacolor 2 appeared in 1975 with more stable metallized dyes. The "Polacolor" backprint began to appear in 1968; "Z" or "E" at the end of alphanumeric code may also be a clue. Adhesive remnants from where the negative sheet was once fixed is often visible if angled to reflect a light source off white matte border. Polaroid also began packaging self-adhesive mount boards for their early peel-apart Polacolor prints.</dd>

</div>
  </dd>
  <dt>Coated peel-apart</dt>
  <dd>Strictly B&amp;W. Initially known as the Polaroid Land process, this peel-apart print requires a protective coating/stabilizer after processing. The image is pulled apart from the negative film and is subsequently hand-coated.  Until 1970, all Polaroid B&amp;W films required this protective polymer coater.</dd>
  <dt>Deterioration/Flaws</dt>
  <dd>All peel-apart prints have some tendency to curl in toward the image.  Occasionally there will be noticeable defects at the image’s edge from an uneven spread of developer between the negative and receiving layers during processing.  The peel-apart print is generally more stable than its integral counterpart.  However, for prints requiring hand-coating (all B&amp;W before 1970), prior to application, the image is extremely susceptible to damage.  Once coated, the image is rather stable.  If coated improperly, localized fading of the image, brownish-yellow streaking and fading may occur. Overall yellowing is also common, particularly in color photo image highlights and border.</dd>
