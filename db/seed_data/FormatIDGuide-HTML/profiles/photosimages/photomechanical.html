<h1>Photomechanical Prints</h1>
<p>A photomechanical print is a mechanical reproduction of a photo image, printed in ink, often by a printer's press. Photomechanical prints are not the product of a photographic process in that the support was never itself light-sensitive and light plays no direct role in image production.  Rather the image has been impressed or transferred mechanically from a inked plate or other surface created using a photographic negative as source. Unlike photographic prints, photomechanical prints generally do not display signs of image fading and can be identified by distinctive patterns under magnification (with the exception of the woodburytype).</p>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A letterpress halftone is comprised of ink on a paper support.  The image may be monochrome, or multiple colors (duo, three, and four-color halftones).  This process can be identified by a sharp-edged large dot or waffle pattern most evident in middle-tone areas viewed under magnification, although older images with coarser dots (and thus lower resolution) may be identifiable by the naked eye.  If polychrome, the image pattern will seem mosaic-like.</p>
    <p>Ink will appear to lay on the paper surface.  Letterpress halftone prints are printed from a metal relief plate, which creates sharply defined edges around typographic matter and the dots which create the image.  These sharp edges are the result of ink being squeezed away from the plate as pressure is applied during the printing process.  Letterpress halftone images are characterized by poor reproduction of detail compared to other photomechanical processes.  Halftone prints do not fade and may be printed on any paper with any color ink.</p>

  <dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>The ink used to produce letterpress halftones generally does not fade and is water-insoluble, but deterioration of the print is largely dependant on the quality of paper support used.

  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>Letterpress halftone is a process that emerged in the 1880s which continues to be produced to the present day, but was most commonly applied as a commercial printing process from the early to mid-20th century.  Halftone printing was often used for postcards, newspapers, magazines, calendars, and other large-scale commercial printing.  Some objects may contain a combination of letterpress halftone with other printing processes, such as chromolithography, to create a colored image.  By the early 1960s, the commercial printing industry had adopted the faster, cheaper, and more colorful offset lithography process, gradually turning away from letterpress halftone printing.</dd>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>An offset lithograph is an ink image on paper support.  The offset lithographic printing process involves transferring ink from the metal lithographic plate onto a secondary plate or cylinder (usually made of rubber), and then transferring the ink to the final paper support.  For color prints, multiple color plate passes are performed.  The offset litho process may be identified by misalignment of these color plates, most apparent in highly-detailed areas or at the edges of an image, where one or more color plates did not match up exactly (resulting in fuzzy image quality).</p>
    <p>Under low magnification, ink will appear to have penetrated the paper, giving images their typical soft-edged appearance.  A regular rosette ink dot pattern can be seen throughout the image or text under low magnification.   If a photolithograph is identified, it can be assumed there were many copies once produced.</p>

  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>Offset lithography was used beginning in 1880 and continues to be used to the present day.  Lithography was invented in 1798 and the original process used a stone as the printing surface.  Since 1880, the offset lithograph press process involves the transfer of ink to a secondary rubber plate or cylinder before printing to the support paper.  Offset lithography has been the predominant photomechanical process used for commercial printing since the 1950s.  Offset copying machines were no longer used in offices by the 1970s, but the process is still an economical and popular means of producing large volumes of printed matter such as newspapers and magazines.</dd>

  <dd>
    <p>A gravure is comprised of an ink image on paper support.  It can be identified by either one of two distinctive ink patterns when viewed under magnification.  Photogravures have a fine, irregular speckled pattern (aquatint grain).  Rotogravures have a regular screen pattern (equally-sized square cells) instead.  Images will bear a high level of detail and highlights will be unmuddled.  Under magnification, paper fibers will be visible in the highlights.  Ink will appear to rest on the matte surface of the paper.</p>
    <p>Gravures were used for fine art reproduction, book illustration, and newspaper and magazine photo sections.  Gravure images may be any color, but those from the early 20th century will likely be brown, dark green, or black.  An embossed plate mark may be present around the edges of a photogravure image (due to printing plate pressure) but could have been trimmed off.  Rotogravures can also have an embossed plate mark, but these were sometimes added to imitate the quality of limited edition photogravures; a clean, uninked edge mark can be a clue of such embellishment.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Photogravure vs. Rotogravure</dt>
  <dd>The terms <em>Photogravure</em> and <em>Rotogravure</em> are often used interchangeably, but each is a separate printing process.  Compositionally they are identical, the method of ink application is all that differentiates them.  Photogravures are limited-run prints hand-pulled on a plate and flatbed press (photogravure process). Photogravures are identified by their aquatint grain pattern.  Rotogravures are high-volume prints traditionally produced with a cylinder and screen. Rotogravures are identified by their soft-edged screen pattern.  Modern variations of the rotogravure process continue to be used in commercial publication (see Background).</dd>

  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>Gravures were produced from the 1870s and continue to be produced to the present day in fine art photography and printing communities.  Limited-run prints were produced on a plate and flatbed press (photogravure process), while high-volume printing was generally executed with a copper cylinder and screen (rotogravure process), which persists in some commercial printing sectors today.  From the early 1910s through the 1950s, the rotogravure process was used to produce large runs of high-quality B&amp;W and color images, usually in special newspaper and magazine pictorial sections, often featuring celebrities and athletes.  Many photography-based books and magazines today are printed using a contemporary version of the rotogravure process, including full-color weekend newspaper inserts and National Geographic.</dd>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A collotype is comprised of an ink image on paper support (sometimes with a baryta layer).  The image is produced on a printing press from a glass plate with a layer of light-sensitive dichromated gelatin.  A negative is exposed on the plate, and areas of the gelatin layer that received more light are  "tanned" and harden, allowing them to hold more ink than untanned areas.  The monochrome image tone depends on the choice of ink, but polychrome values could be achieved through hand-coloring, stencils, or multiple-pass printing of separate color plates.</p>
    <p>Under magnification, a brain- or worm-like reticulation pattern can be seen.  Surface finishes vary from matte to glossy, but are typically matte (unvarnished).  Collotypes exhibit no image fading, and have glossier ink than photogravures, evident in shadows.  Collotypes often appear as book illustrations, movie lobby cards, postcards, and topographical views.  A collotype postcard will likely have  "Albertype" printed on the verso.  Since text and images could not be printed at the same time using the collotype process, it was often combined with other printing processes such as letterpress for the application of text. </p>

  <dd>Collotypes were in wide circulation from the 1870s to the 1940s, though are still produced today. Collotypes briefly unseated woodburytypes in the late 19th century and subsequently receded gradually after the early 1900s. The process resulted in highly detailed reproductions of photographic images and was popular among publishers who wanted to mimic the appearance of silver gelatin photographs in book illustrations, movie lobby cards, and postcards.  Ink colors, paper, and varnishes were often chosen to imitate photographic prints.  In all prints produced after the 1870s, the distinctive worm-like pattern will be observable under magnification.  This reticulation pattern is a result of the glass plate being heated in an oven to accelerate drying the gelatin layer.</dd>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A woodburytype print is comprised of a coated paper support with gelatin binder and carbon pigment image.  Woodburytypes resemble carbon prints but differ in that they are produced through a photomechanical, rather than photographic, process.  Woodburytypes were made on a special printing press using pigmented gelatin as the "ink" (Reilly, 1986).  Unlike other photomechanical processes, they have no discernible grain pattern and are capable of reproducing the continuous tone of a photographic image.  Although they are very similar to carbon prints, woodburytypes exhibit slightly more of an image relief effect in shadow areas, which are glossier and more elevated than in highlights (differential gloss).  Paper fibers can be seen under magnification in highlight areas.  Woodburytypes are also usually smaller than carbon prints, and are never larger than 11" × 14".</p>
    <figure><img src="images/woodburytype-label-detail-300.jpg" alt="Woodburytype label" width="300" height="116"><figcaption>Example of a Woodburytype label.</figcaption></figure><p>Woodburytypes were often used as book illustration and pages will typically be labeled  "Woodburytype" or have marginal print or border lines.  If loose, they are usually trimmed and mounted on a secondary support such as a cabinet card (6¼" × 4¼"), carte-de-visite (2½" × 4¼"), stereocard (about 3½" × 7"), or glass.  Under magnification, the sheared edges will show slight deformities of paper fiber and pigmented gelatin.</p>

  <dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>Woodburytype prints display little or no fading or yellowing.  Darker areas of the image may develop large cracks, where the gelatin layer is thickest.  These cracks will often be visible to the naked eye.  Image edges or corners may exhibit cracking or lifting of the gelatin layer.  As with all prints on paper, they are susceptible to mechanical damage and staining.  When found unmounted, woodburytypes will have a tendency to curl in on themselves.</dd>
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd>Low. The preservation risk of a woodburytype largely depends on the type of paper on which it was printed. </dd>
  <dt>Common Size(s)</dt>
  <dd>Variable; Never larger than 11" × 14", and usually smaller than 7" × 9.5".  Prints are often trimmed and mounted on a secondary support.</dd>
  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>Woodburytype prints were produced from 1866 to the early 1910s.  Unlike other photomechanical ink-on-paper processes, woodburytypes could reproduce delicate continuous tone to the extent that they are virtually indistinguishable from true photographs of the period (i.e. carbon prints).  Typically produced for high-end book illustration, magazines, promotional materials, and for sale as individual, cardmount prints.  Though the woodburytype was regarded as the most refined and faithful of 19th century photomechanical processes, it was gradually replaced by the more versatile collotype process in the late 19th century. </dd>
