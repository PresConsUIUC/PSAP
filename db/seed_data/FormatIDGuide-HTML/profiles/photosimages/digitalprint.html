<h1>Digital Prints</h1>
<p>A digital print is any image or document that has been printed from a digital source, i.e. a digital image file. Though this term becomes progressively more problematic as computers become more central to reformatting efforts, it is perhaps our best fit. So, like photomechanical prints, digital prints are not the direct products of a photographic process in that the support was never itself light-sensitive. Rather, the print is created by the application of coloring agents (ink, toner, etc.) to a support (typically paper, plastic, or cloth, but this list is growing). As printing technologies progress, processes grow: inkjet, electrophotographic (laser printing), color carbro, dye sublimation, as well as modern photomechanical computer-to-plate processes (photopolymer plates, lithography). For most non-art collections, however, the most common digital print formats will be of the desktop printing variety: inkjet or laser prints, which are the only processes featured here.</p>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>An inkjet print is comprised of a paper support and a pigment- or dye-based ink. Paper may be uncoated or resin-coated (RC), and either pigment or dye-based ink may be used. The inkjet printing process involves the application of tiny droplets of ink onto the paper surface. This super-fine dot structure produced by the printer’s ink spray will be visible under low magnification.  As inkjet printers evolved, the dot structure became finer and less distinguishable to the naked eye.  Images produced by ink on uncoated papers will appear fuzzy and ill-defined while ink on coated papers will retain the dot formation and present crisp detail.  A pigment-based ink on coated (glossy) paper will exhibit a differential surface gloss between areas of high and low ink density, especially when viewed under direct light.</dd>

  <dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>Deterioration of inkjet prints depends greatly on the quality of the paper and type of ink.  In general, contemporary inkjet prints (after the 1990s) will more chemically permanent than their more predominantly dye-based predecessors. Inkjet prints are also highly sensitive to surface abrasion due to the ink’s shallow, delicate deposits; uncoated papers are more vulnerable to mechanical damage than coated.  Inkjet on swellable coated paper is less susceptible to airborne pollutants and abrasion since the inks are embedded in the image-receiving layer.  Porous coated paper, however, does not buffer the effects of either.  See <a href="#inkjetpapers">Inkjet Papers</a> for additional information on uncoated, porous, and swellable papers.  All inkjet prints should be protected from humidity and light exposure, even neutral B&amp;W prints will quickly discolor and fade to a yellowish-brown color.</dd>
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd>Moderate to high. Preservation risks are highly variable, depending on ink and paper type, colorants (dye or pigment), receiving layer, even original printer settings. Inkjet prints are prone to yellowing and staining, especially if exposed to high humidity, intense light, or atmospheric pollutants such as ozone. Ink bleeding, streaking, and distortion may occur if exposed to moisture.  Pigment-based inks are considerably more stable than dye-based, but may also be water-based—and thusly sensitive to moisture.</dd>
  <dt>Common Size(s)</dt>
  <dd>Varied;  Due to their broad application, inkjet prints may be found in a multitude of sizes, though many will measure 8.5" × 11" and under.</dd>
  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>Inkjet printers were developed in the 1950s but were not viable until the late 1970s. It was not until the 1990s that color photographic print quality was achieved and inkjet printers truly arrived in the amateur market.  From then on, inkjet printing has remained one of the most popular print processes for digital files, text or images.</dd>

  <dt>Storage Enclosure(s)</dt>
  <dd>Acid-free (pH 7.2–9.5) enclosures and/or folders strongly advised.  Each print should have its own enclosure to protect it from ink bleeds, dust, handling damage, and environmental shifting.  This enclosure may be a paper (conservation-quality, acid-free) or plastic (uncoated polyester, polyethylene, polypropylene, cellulose triacetate) sleeve, envelope, or wrapper. vPosition image side away from seams in paper enclosures.  Such seams should be on the sides of the enclosure, not down its center. Enclosures should be stored in hanging file folders or archival storage boxes.  Avoid wood cabinets.  Enameled steel, stainless steel, or anodized aluminum are preferred.  All storage materials should pass the Photographic Activity Test (PAT) as specified in ISO Standard 18916:2007.</dd>
  <dt>Storage Orientation</dt>
  <dd>Never stack inkjet prints in indefinite storage. Store vertically with dividers between each print.  May also be stored horizontally (flat), especially large format prints. Avoid folding or rolling prints. Enclosures and folders may be stored in hanging files or archival storage boxes.</dd>
  <dt>Display Recommendations</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The duration of an exhibit should be determined in advance, and no item should be placed on display permanently.  Most items should not be displayed for longer than 3 to 4 months, assuming other conditions such as light levels, temperature, and relative humidity are within acceptable ranges.  Facsimiles or items of low artifactual value may be exhibited for longer periods of time.  Between display periods it should be returned to an appropriate environment where it may "rest" in dark storage.</p>
    <p>Light levels should be kept as low as possible.  When on display, objects should be protected from exposure to natural light, which contains high levels of UV radiation.  Shades, curtains, or filters applied directly to windows will help to minimize this exposure.  This is particularly important for inkjet prints, which are very sensitive to light.</p>
    <p>Display cases should be enclosed and sealed to protect their contents, and items securely framed or matted using preservation-quality materials which have passed the Photographic Activity Test (ISO18916).</p>

<h2 id="inkjetpapers">Inkjet Photo Papers</h2>
<p>Inkjet papers are varied and complex.  The types of paper described here are a general guide.  Manufacturers typically do not indicate whether a paper is porous or swellable, but there are a few characteristics that can aid in identification.  If a paper is labelled "instant dry" it is porous.  Swellable papers may be labeled as "fast drying."  Swellable papers may also be labeled as "high gloss" rather than just "glossy."  Many inkjet printing papers have a manufacturer stamp on the back indicating the product name or brand; this also may be used to identify the paper type.</p>

<h3 id="uncoatedinkjet">Uncoated paper</h3>
<p>Uncoated paper is typically used for printing documents, and does not yield high-quality image reproductions.  The amount of ink used to print images usually causes the paper to cockle.  Since the ink is absorbed directly by the paper, images are not vibrant or sharp.  Some uncoated papers, marketed especially for inkjet printers, are treated to address these problems; however print quality is still lower than prints made with swellable or porous paper.  Images printed on uncoated paper are likely the result of a consumer-grade inkjet printer and were probably printed in a home or office.  Commercially produced prints are typically made on coated papers.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="swellableinkjet">Swellable coated paper</h3>
<p>Swellable paper is comprised of resin-coated paper with an image-receiving layer.  The image-receiving layer swells to absorb the liquid ink as it is sprayed during the printing process.  This results in a vibrant, crisp image that sits in a layer on top of the paper rather than absorbing into it.  Only dye-based inks are used to print on swellable paper, since pigment inks cannot absorb into the image-receiving layer.  Swellable paper typically has a glossy finish which mimics traditional photo paper prints.  Images printed on coated swellable paper may be produced professionally or at home.  Swellable papers have decreased in popularity due to the fact that prints take some time to dry completely (sometimes up to 24 hours), as opposed to porous papers which dry instantly.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="porousinkjet">Porous coated paper</h3>
<p>Porous paper is comprised of paper, with optional resin-coating, with a surface layer of mineral particles attached to the paper by a polymer binder.  These mineral particles create tiny pores on the surface of the paper which absorb ink and dry instantly.  Porous paper typically is not as glossy as swellable paper, and is manufactured with and without the RC layer.  Porous paper without RC layers may be classified as "fine art paper" and is used to produce fine art prints, or giclée prints (not all fine art inkjet papers are porous papers, however).  Images printed on porous paper may be produced professionally or at home.  Inkjet prints on porous paper are more susceptible to abrasion than prints on swellable paper.</p>

<h2 id="inkjetinks">Inkjet Inks</h2>
<p>Inks used in inkjet photo printers can be either predominantly dye-based or pigment-based.</p>
<h3 id="dyeinkjet">Dye-based ink</h3>
<p>Dye-based inks are cheaper and therefore used more widely than pigment-based inks, in both home and office settings.  Dye inks, however, are prone to a number of preservation issues.  Dye inks are very sensitive to moisture and will spread and run if even a single drop of water is introduced to the print surface.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="pigmentinkjet">Pigment-based ink</h3>
<p>Pigment inks resist water quite well and are less likely to run or smear due to moisture.  Pigment inks are also more lightfast than dye-based inks, and, if printed on a good-quality paper, may last more than 100 years before any fading occurs.  The main preservation concern with pigment ink prints is that pigment inks are more prone to abrasion, especially in areas of dense, dark color.  Pigment inks may also be identified by a differential surface gloss between areas of high ink density and areas where no ink is present.</p>
