<dt>Dates</dt>
  <dd>c. 1898 – late 1950s</dd>
  <dt>Common Size(s)</dt>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Wire recording is a recorded sound format made of magnetized recording-grade steel or stainless steel wire. The wire is wound around a plastic or metal spool and can be virtually any length. Wire audio was invented in 1898, and was used primarily as a home recording and dictation format until the 1960s.</dd>
  <dt>Composition</dt>
  <dd>Magnetized steel or stainless steel wire wound around spool (plastic or metal)</dd>
  <dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>
<p>One of the most common issues with wire recordings is tangled wire. The wire is extremely thin (approximately .004 inches thick) and can wrap around itself and become tangled and possibly break. This problem is an annoyance but can be relatively easily resolved—the wire just needs to be untangled and rewound onto the reel. Breaks in the wire can be repaired by knotting the two ends of the wire together. Since wire travels at a high transport speed, the knot will be a minor sonic disturbance during playback.</p>
<p>Although the wire is generally composed of recording-grade stainless steel, some recordings prior to WWII were made on steel wire, which is prone to rust. Occurrences of rust are typically rare. It can weaken the already thin wire and cause the wire to break during handling or playback and can impede signal retrieval.</p>
<p>Signal print through can also be an issue. Print through occurs when the magnetized signal from one section of the wire migrates to lower sections and leaves a sonic imprint. Print through is often identifiable when a faint pre- or post-echo is heard during playback. Storing the wire in a tails-out manner— with the end of the wire on the outermost layer of the spool— can aid in minimizing some of the sonic disturbance. Storing the wire tails-out minimizes pre-echo, which is often more annoying than post-echo. However, storing the wire tails-out does not prevent print through from occurring.</p>
</dd>
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd>Wire recording media and equipment are long obsolete, and based on the content, should be considered a high priority for reformatting.</dd>

  
  <dt>Playback</dt>
  <dd>Wire can tangle and break, especially during playback. It is thin and, depending upon the material, can be susceptible to rust. Any surface abrasion or contaminant can wear down the playback heads on a wire recording. Additionally, playback equipment is increasingly difficult to find. Preservation playback and reformatting may be handled best by a vendor who has experience with handling this format.</dd>
  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>Wire recording was the first magnetic media recording technology. It was developed by Vlademar Poulsen in 1898 and was in popular use until the late 1940s, when magnetic tape emerged as the choice home and dictation recording medium. However, wire continued to be used in military, commercial, office, and home environments as late as the early 1960s.</dd>

      </tr></tbody>

</dd>
  <dt>Storage Enclosure(s)</dt>
  <dd>Removing the wire recordings from their original cardboard containers—which are subject to mold infestation and do not protect the recordings from moisture—and storing the recordings in a protective plastic container or archival quality paperboard enclosure is recommended.</dd>
  <dt>Storage Orientation</dt>
  <dd>Secure the wire around the reel so that it does not become loose and tangle; you can use either unrecorded stainless steel wire or plastic as leader. Some professionals recommend storing wires in the "tails out" (end of the recording at the top of the reel rather than close to the hub of the reel) to lessen the effects of print through. However, this may not be practical due to the scarcity of wire recording equipment and the risk involved in mounting the wire on the playback equipment.</dd>
  <dt>Handling/Care</dt>
  <dd>Keep magnetic media away from stray electromagnetic fields; avoid devices with a motor or transformer, all of which generate an alternating magnetic field. Never leave media in a playback machine; always return to storage enclosure when not in use.</dd>
