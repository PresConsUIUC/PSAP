<h1>Other/Unknown Media Types</h1>
<p>There are many kinds of media formats. The PSAP was designed to assess audiovisual formats most commonly found in institutions in the United States. As comprehensive as the PSAP is, we recognize that you may have formats in your collections that don't fit into the format types we've listed in this resource. If you find you have a media type that the Format ID Guide doesn't cover, there are resources to which you may turn to find out more about that media type's care. Following is a list of professional organizations and their email listservs. If you find you have a format that you can't identify, posting a message to these lists can usually put you in touch with a professional who can help you learn more about it.</p>
