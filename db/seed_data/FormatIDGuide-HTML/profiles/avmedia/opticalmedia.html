  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>DVD is a digital optical disc format which can hold moving image or recorded sound material. DVDs are the same dimensions as CDs: 120mm in diameter and 1.2mm thickness. DVDs, however, can be made up of two discs of 0.6mm thickness, which are bonded together (Bradley, 2006). A disc may hold content on a single side or on both sides. The amount of content stored on the disc depends on how the content is compressed; if the data is heavily compressed, more data will fit on the disc. Some discs are recordable (DVD-/+R) and some discs can be written, erased, and recorded multiple times (DVD-RW).</dd>
  <dt>Composition</dt>
  <dd>Polycarbonate plastic disc substrate coated with a thin, reflective "data layer" composed of metal (commercial DVDs) or contains dyes (recordable, rewritable DVDs); DVDs may also be dual-layered/-sided.</dd>
  <dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>
<p>Most DVD damage is incurred through poor storage and handling. Surface scratches, gouges, and smudges can inhibit playback of the disc. There may be some inherent vice within the materials used to create DVDs, but signal loss due to inherent vice is not as frequent in newer DVDs. Scratches on the label side of commercially produced DVDs are less damaging than they are to CDs, as DVDs have an extra layer of polycarbonate that protects the metallic recording layer within the disc. All optical media should be stored in cool, dry, and dark conditions.</p>

<p>Data on DVDs, especially non-replicated, recordable/rewritable DVDs, is subject to loss over time. All optical media should be regularly checked for data degradation.</p>

<p>DVD "relies on the interaction of the individual burner, the medium, and the individual player" (Bradley, 2006, p. ii). Discs recorded at higher speeds tend to use less dye when encoding the signal, which is "a contributing factor in the long term failure of recordable optical media" (p. 9).</p>
</dd>
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd>
<p>Playback equipment and media are still readily available for this format. Recordable discs, especially those recorded at high speeds, may have significantly shorter life spans than other discs.</p>

<p>Optical media should not be considered an archival format due to the high cost of maintenance and error-checking. Recordable discs may be appropriate as a temporary solution for small oral history archives that hold a small collection of compact cassettes that are in need of immediate reformatting, and who are under funding restraints (ARSC Technical Committee, 2009). However, transfer to optical media should not be considered the final stage for this type of archival preservation.</p>
</dd>
  <dt>Playback</dt>
  <dd>Commercial DVDs may contain region code information. Discs with this encoded information require playback equipment that corresponds to the discs' region code. Recordable/rewritable DVDs can be recorded at varying speeds. Since the recording speed of more recent players has increased, older DVD players may not be able to handle discs recorded at higher speeds. If you encounter an issue playing back a DVD in one machine, try playing it back in another machine before concluding that the fault lies with the DVD.</dd>
  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>DVDs were first introduced to the marketplace around 1996. Throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, DVD supplanted videocassette as the primary physical video format, though trends suggest that solid-state flash drives,cloud storage, and online video streaming is supplanting optical disc formats entirely.</dd>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Compact Disc (CD) is a digital optical disc format that can hold a variety of digital material, including recorded sound and moving image. Data capacity, however, prevents the storage of extremely large movie files. CDs are the same dimensions as DVDs: 120mm diameter and 1.2mm thick. Content is only stored on one side of the disc. The amount of content on the disc depends on how the content is compressed; if the data is heavily compressed, more data will fit on the disc. Some discs are recordable (CD-/+R) and some discs can be written, erased, and recorded multiple times (CD-RW).</dd>

  <dd>
<p>Most CD damage is incurred through poor storage and handling. Surface scratches, gouges, and smudges can inhibit playback of the disc. There may be some inherent vice within the materials used to create CDs, but signal loss due to inherent vice is not as frequent in newer CDs. If the seal encasing the aluminum recording surface is somehow compromised, the aluminum layer can oxidize, resulting in data loss. This deterioration is colloquially referred to as "disc rot" or "laser rot." Indications of disc rot include: pin-sized holes in the reflective layer, a bronze coloring on the non-labeled side of the disc, and crazing. Crazing can be seen in snowflake-like or fractal-like milky-white patterns on the disc. Crazing typically only affects early CDs because as manufacturing processes improved, the issue became less of a problem. Scratches on the label side of CDs can also affect playback, since CDs are relatively thin and composed of a single layer of reflective aluminum encased in polycarbonate. Any discs that exhibit these signs of deterioration should be error checked and/or replaced.</p>

  <dt>Playback</dt>
  <dd>
<p>Although all CDs look the same, there are several different formats: CD+G (Compact Disc plus Graphics), CD-I (Compact Disc-Interactive), CD-R (Compact Disc-Recordable) and CD-RW (Compact Disc-Rewritable). These formats may require specific playback equipment (e.g. CD+G), playback equipment that supports delivery of both audio and video content (e.g. CD-I), and/or equipment that can read discs written at lower/higher spin speeds. CD-R and CD-RW, depending upon when they were created and the disc writer capabilities, may not be playable in all CD players or CD-Rom drives.</p>
<p>Differing CD formats and technical considerations are detailed in various "color book" standards (see Color Standards below). Compact Disc Digital Audio (CDDA) conforms to the Red Book Standard, which specifies a number of technical aspects, including maximum playing time (74 minutes).</p>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>LaserDisc is an analog optical disc format. While this format is read via a laser, the signal is typically analog—although some audio tracks on the LaserDisc can be encoded digitally. Discs released before the mid-1980s are also known by other trademarked names such as Reflective Optical Videodisc, Laser Videodisc, Laservision, and MCA DiscoVision. LaserDisc is a trademarked name given to a version of this optical storage format developed by the Philips Corporation, but has become the common name for this format. Different disc formats may require proprietary equipment for playback. The discs are approximately 12" (30.4cm) in diameter—the size of a standard LP vinyl disc—but some specialty sizes are also known to exist.</dd>
  <dt>Composition</dt>

  <dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>
<p>LaserDiscs are subject to mechanical and surface contaminants. Scratches and dirt can drastically affect laser performance, as playback equipment can become misaligned and mistracked. Additionally, LaserDiscs do not have some of the error correction technology that later optical media have, and they are much more sensitive to damage.</p>

</div>
  
<p>Inherent vice also affects LaserDisc. Some manufacturing defects adversely affect the lifespan and playback quality of the discs. Discs may succumb to surface crazing, where the surface of the discs exhibits a milky white, lattice, or spider web-like pattern. Crazing can indicate that the seal which protects the inner aluminum signal carrier has broken, making the inner core vulnerable to oxidation. Oxidation is also known as laser rot, as the aluminum loses its reflectivity and the quality of the playback signal degrades. Oxidation of the delicate aluminum can render the signal irretrievable.</p>
</dd>
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd>LaserDiscs and players are long obsolete. Based on the value and uniqueness of the content, these discs should be prioritized for preservation reformatting.</dd>
  <dt>Playback</dt>
  <dd>
<p>The earliest forms of LaserDisc may require proprietary playback equipment, as in the case of DiscoVision discs. Since LaserDisc players are long obsolete and used players are most likely over 20 years old, playback may be hindered by mechanical failure and/or track or laser misalignment. Track misalignment can degrade the quality of the playback signal and can introduce "crosstalk," where signals from contiguous tracks bleed into the track being played.</p>
<p>LaserDiscs only hold a maximum of 55 minutes of data (depending on the type of disc). As such, discs may be double sided. Data-rich content such as a feature-length film may be recorded on several discs. During playback, users must manually change discs or flip the disc over in order to continue accessing the material.</p>
</dd>
  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>LaserDiscs and players were commercially available in the late 1970s. Although most LaserDiscs were commercial releases, they were also used for information dissemination in industrial and educational settings.</dd>

  <dd>Disc diameter: 64mm</dd>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>MiniDisc is a digital recorded sound format. It uses similar encoding technology as CD, although the disc is enclosed in a cartridge measuring approximately 7cm square. There are two distinct types of MiniDisc: Pre-recorded, which is very similar to CD in operation and manufacture, and Recordable MDs, which can be recorded repeatedly and employ magneto-optical technology (MiniDisc.org, n.d.).</dd>
  <dt>Composition</dt>
  <dd>Magneto-optical disc (ferromagnetic material under plastic layer) enclosed in a plastic cartridge with a sliding door</dd>
  <dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>Information encoded on MiniDiscs is stored in a compressed format. As MiniDiscs are recorded, the data stream is compressed. Audio quality begins to degrade when subsequent copies are made and the disc undergoes multiple re-compression. Thus, copies made from MiniDiscs, even digital copies, are not true clones and will be more compressed than the master disc. This will affect the audio quality (MiniDisc.org, n.d.).</dd>
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd>Specific playback equipment is required to access the content. Since the information encoded on a MiniDisc is compressed, and since the format is not as widely adopted as other formats, it is not an archival medium. Equipment obsolescence is not yet a high risk; however, the compression scheme employed in recordable MiniDiscs (ATRAC) is proprietary and unpublished (IASA, 2003). It is not yet clear if previous generations of ATRAC recordings will be retrievable in future iterations. Pre-recorded MiniDiscs are relatively stable and similar to CDs, and may be a low priority for transfer. However, unique content contained on a recordable MiniDisc should be considered a high priority for preservation reformatting (IASA, 2003).</dd>
  <dt>Playback</dt>
  <dd>Specific playback equipment corresponding to the media is required to access content.</dd>
  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>MiniDiscs were introduced in the early 1990s by the Sony Corporation. It was marketed as a medium for recording and distributing near-CD quality consumer audio and was designed to replace the analog cassette tape. Manufacture of the MiniDisc ceased in late 2013, but some use persists today, namely in field journalism.</dd>
