  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Two-inch open reel audio is a magnetic tape-based recorded sound format. The tape is composed of magnetic particles, binder, and a base of either acetate or polyester. Two -inch did not come into widespread use until the late 1960s. Not until the early 1970s did 24-track recording appear; 16-track was the solitary configuration up to that point. Acetate bases can be differentiated from polyester bases by conducting a quick light test. Hold the reel up to a light source—if light "pipes" through, the base is most likely acetate. Reel size can vary, measuring from 2 or 3 inches to 10.5 inches in diameter (14-inch diameters are also possible), with 5, 7, and 10.5 inches being the most common sizes found in archives (Paton, 1998). The tape width is approximately 2".</dd>

  <dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Two-inch open reel audio is susceptible to risks associated with age, hardware, and equipment obsolescence. Like other types of magnetic media, it is prone to risks such as mold, binder deterioration, physical damage, signal drop-outs, and, in the case of acetate-based tapes, base deterioration.</p>
    <p>Tapes should be wound tightly and evenly. An uneven tape pack can allow dirt to come in contact with and abrade the tape's surface and edges. Unevenly wound tapes can cause the tape to warp and lose its shape, which will affect playback sound quality.</p>
    <p>Tapes are also prone to blocking or pinning, which occurs when layers of tape adhere to adjacent layers. Blocking involves large sections of tape adhered together, while pinning involves small sections. Both blocking and pinning can result in loss of information by damaging the tape layers or by preventing playback. Other issues are print-through, sticky shed syndrome (binder hydrolysis) and soft binder syndrome in many polyester-based tapes, and, in the case of acetate-based tapes, vinegar syndrome.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd>Reel-to-reel audio playback equipment and media are becoming scarce, although there are a few manufacturers who are still filling the needs of professional audio studios. Since magnetic media is a dying medium with a limited lifespan, these tapes should be reformatted (based on the content value).</dd>
  <dt>Playback</dt>
  <dd>In order to play back a tape properly, you must know the tape track configuration and recording speed. Playback equipment must have a tape transport able to support the full width of the tape, in addition to the proper playback head configuration, to read all the tracks encoded on the tape.</dd>
  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>Open reel audiotape was developed in Germany in the late 1930s. After WWII, it was further developed in the US by Ampex and EMI, when it began to gain worldwide popularity. Open reel formats with larger tape widths (½" and above) and recorded at faster speeds (7½ ips and above) are most commonly found in  broadcasting and high-quality production environments. The 2-inch open reel audiotape was used in professional multitrack recording applications.</dd>

  <dt>Storage Enclosure(s)</dt>
  <dd>
  <p>Acid-free enclosures are strongly advised. Each item should have its own enclosure to protect it from dust, handling damage, and changes in environmental conditions. All storage materials should pass the Photographic Activity Test (PAT) as specified in ISO Standard 18916:2007. In all, this means they must be chemically and physically stable:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Plastics:</b> Polyethylene, polypropylene or polyester (a.k.a. Mylar D or Melinex 516). No PVC or acetate.</li>
<li>
<b>Paper/Paperboard:</b> Neutral pH, lignin-free, buffered materials recommended.</li>
</ul>
<p>The container should support the reel by the hub so to preserve the tape pack and prevent distortion of the tape. Use unslotted reels if possible. It is also recommended that you use acid-free archival hold-down tape to secure loose ends of the open reel tape.</p>
<p>Whenever feasible, replace original cardboard containers as they are typically non-archival (acidic) and have little or no hub support. An enclosure must be truly clean so to protect the fragile tape surface; dust and dirt abrasions can affect sound quality and even render it unplayable. Moldy, damaged, and dirty containers must be replaced.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Storage Orientation</dt>
  <dd>Store all magnetic tape vertically (on end, inside case). Stacking any tape format horizontally, or even allowing it to lean for too long, could compromise a tape pack and at worst cause warping. As stated above, the container should provide hub support for the reel so to preserve the pack and prevent distortion.</dd>
  <dt>Handling/Care</dt>
  <dd>Never touch the surface of a magnetic tape recording. Handle by the hub instead. Do not pull on the tape or squeeze the reel flanges; this places stress on the tape, potentially causing distortion and damage.  Never leave media in a playback machine; always return to storage enclosure when not in use.</dd>

    <p>Quarter-inch open reel audio is susceptible to risks associated with age, hardware, and equipment obsolescence. Like other types of magnetic media, it is prone to risks such as mold, binder deterioration, physical damage, signal drop-outs, and, in the case of acetate-based tapes, base deterioration. Quarter-inch tape may be thinner and more fragile than other kinds of tape, and is more susceptible to stretching and breaking during playback.</p>
    <p>Tapes should be wound tightly and evenly. An uneven tape pack can allow dirt to come in contact with and abrade the tape's surface and edges. Unevenly wound tapes can cause the tape to warp and lose its shape, which will affect playback sound quality. Tapes with thinner widths are more susceptible to information loss when the tape edge is damaged, as magnetic track configurations are smaller and placed more closely to the tape edge.</p>
    <p>Tapes are also prone to blocking or pinning, which occurs when layers of tape adhere to adjacent layers. Blocking involves large sections of tape adhered together, while pinning involves small sections. Both blocking and pinning can result in loss of information by damaging the tape layers or by preventing playback.</p>

<p>The container should support the reel by the hub so to preserve the tape pack and prevent distortion of the tape. Use unslotted reels if possible. It is also recommended that you use acid-free archival hold-down tape to secure loose ends of the open reel tape.</p>
<p>Whenever feasible, replace original cardboard containers as they are typically non-archival (acidic) and have little or no hub support. An enclosure must be truly clean so to protect the fragile tape surface; dust and dirt abrasions can affect sound quality and even render it unplayable. Moldy, damaged, and dirty containers must be replaced.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Storage Orientation</dt>
  <dd>Store all magnetic tape vertically (on end, inside case). Stacking any tape format horizontally, or even allowing it to lean for too long, could compromise a tape pack and at worst cause warping. As stated above, the container should provide hub support for the reel so to preserve the pack and prevent distortion.</dd>
  <dt>Handling/Care</dt>
  <dd>Never touch the surface of a magnetic tape recording. Handle by the hub instead. Do not pull on the tape or squeeze the reel flanges; this places stress on the tape, potentially causing distortion and damage.  Never leave media in a playback machine; always return to storage enclosure when not in use.</dd>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Continuous loop cartridge (cart) is a magnetic tape-based recorded sound format, and the 4-track precursor to the 8-track cartridge. The tape is composed of magnetic particles (or pigment), binder, and a base. Carts are composed of ¼ inch plastic oxide-coated recording tape wound around a single internal reel and housed in a plastic enclosure. Although carts appear similar to an 8-track, they are distinctly different and are identifiable by a fairly large hole in the lower left backside of the cartridge. Cartridge dimensions are generally 133mm × 101mm × 23mm (NAB A type) but can be found in both smaller and larger sizes (NAB type B and C) depending upon end use and tape length.</dd>

  <dd>Polyester magnetic tape enclosed in a plastic cartridge</dd>
  <dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>Magnetic tape is susceptible to physical, biological, and chemical risks such as stretching, breaking, drop-outs, mold, and binder deterioration. Additionally, due to binder lubrication and wind issues, carts are subject to binding and tension problems.</dd>
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd>Continuous loop cartridges are especially susceptible to risks associated with age, hardware, and equipment obsolescence. As carts have been largely replaced by digital technology, the media and related playback equipment are largely obsolete. Since carts are often found in broadcast and other working environments, they most likely have been subject to heavy use. Frequent playback wears down the media and degrades the sound quality over time. This format is especially vulnerable and based on content assessment should be prioritized for reformatting.</dd>
  <dt>Playback</dt>
  <dd>Each audiovisual medium requires equipment to decode the information held within it. The oldest carts, the Audiovendor, were playable on an open reel machine. Subsequent cartridges required proprietary playback equipment until 1964, with the implementation of the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) audio cartridge standard. Although most carts resemble a commercial 8-track cartridge, they cannot be played back on an 8-track machine. Most carts have tape configurations of mono or two-track stereo; both configurations hold a third cueing track. NAB carts have a typical playback speed of 7.5 inches per second (ips); however, playback speed can range from 3.75 ips to 15 ips. Due to the single reel design, carts cannot be rewound; however, fast-forward is possible if the playback machine has the functionality to do so.</dd>
  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>Continuous loop cartridges for automatic playback were introduced in the 1950s and were in use primarily in broadcasting until the late 1990s, when MiniDisc and other more sophisticated automated broadcast tools became available. Some major tape manufacturers include Mackenzie Program Repeater, Fidelipac, and Telex "Cart" (Stauderman, 2003).</dd>

  <dt>Storage Enclosure(s)</dt>
  <dd>
  <p>Acid-free enclosures are strongly advised. Each item should have its own enclosure to protect it from dust, handling damage, and changes in environmental conditions. All storage materials should pass the Photographic Activity Test (PAT) as specified in ISO Standard 18916:2007. In all, this means they must be chemically and physically stable:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Plastics:</b> Polyethylene, polypropylene or polyester (a.k.a. Mylar D or Melinex 516). No PVC or acetate.</li>
<li>
<b>Paper/Paperboard:</b> Neutral pH, lignin-free, buffered materials recommended.</li>
</ul>
<p>Inert plastic containers are ideal. If housed in a plastic container and you are unsure if it is inert or is acceptable, check the condition of the container. If it is protecting the media from dust, pests, and other contaminants, not shedding or introducing any contaminants through its own degradation, and is clean and free of mold or excessive dirt, the container is acceptable. Anything other than a hard plastic container, e.g. a cardboard slipcover, or is not sufficiently protected, it should be rehoused in a clean, inert plastic container.</p>
<p>An enclosure must be truly clean so to protect the fragile tape surface; dust and dirt abrasions can affect sound quality and even render it unplayable. Moldy, damaged, and dirty containers must be replaced.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Storage Orientation</dt>
  <dd>The best orientation for a cassette is vertical (on its end). Cassettes and cartridges, generally speaking, like to be stored upright on shelves like books. Piling tapes one upon the other tends to stress the cassettes at bottom; this can, over time, cause the plastic housing to warp and even crack. Even allowing cassettes to lean for too long in a suboptimal environment could lead to distortion.</dd>
  <dt>Handling/Care</dt>
  <dd>Engage the record protection mechanism if it has not already been done (see Record Protection). Do not attempt to open a tape cassette/cartridge; this is likely to cause greater damage unless you know what you are doing. Furthermore, never touch the magnetic tape surface. Keep magnetic media away from stray electromagnetic fields; avoid devices with a motor or transformer, all of which generate an alternating magnetic field. Never leave media in a playback machine; always return to storage enclosure when not in use.</dd>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Compact cassette is a magnetic tape-based recorded sound format. The tape is composed of magnetic particles (or pigment), binder, and a polyester base. Cassettes are composed of ⅛ inch plastic pigment-coated recording tape wound around two internal reels and housed in a plastic enclosure. Ferric oxide is the most common pigment; other pigments include chromium dioxide, metal particle, and metal evaporated tape (Stauderman, 2003). Cassette dimensions are approximately 4" × 2½" × ½".</dd>

  <dd>Polyester magnetic tape enclosed in a plastic cassette</dd>
  <dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>Magnetic tape is susceptible to physical, biological, and chemical risks such as stretching, breaking, drop-outs, improper wind, mold, binder deterioration, and unintended recording. Compact cassettes with tape lengths of longer than 90 minutes are especially prone to print-through, stretching, and breaking as the tape is thinner than shorter length tapes. Frequent playback wears on the media and degrades the sound quality over time. This medium is especially susceptible to damage from playback as it may jam in the playback deck and be "eaten," which can cause crimping and breaking during playback. Internal cassette elements such as pads and rollers are susceptible to damage. Cassette housings can be repaired and replaced in the event of damage. Doreen Bolnick and Bruce Johnson's (1989) article "Audiocassette Repair" (Library Journal, 114(19), pp. 43-46) is an excellent resource if you are interested in learning about repairing your own compact cassettes.</dd>
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd>The lifespan of a cassette is dependent upon numerous factors: the quality of the original tape, the type and condition of the machine on which it is played, the amount of care the tapes are given, how often they are played, and how they are packaged. Environmental conditions, especially heat, dust, and humidity, may also affect cassettes (Bolnick &amp; Johnson, 1989). As this format is greatly declining in popularity, media and equipment obsolescence may become a risk; however, at present time both media and equipment are available in the marketplace. Frequent playback wears on the media and, with each playback, degrades the sound quality. The compact cassette medium is not considered an archival format due to its very limited projected lifespan of 10 to 30 years, in addition to its various technological issues. This format is vulnerable and, based on content assessment, should be prioritized for reformatting. Standard analog audio cassettes are not suitable for preservation work under any circumstances (Paton, 1998).</dd>
  <dt>Playback</dt>
  <dd>All audiovisual media require equipment to decode the information held within it. Most compact cassettes have a playback speed of 1 ⅞ ips; however, some recorders were designed to optionally record and play back at 3 ¾ ips for better fidelity (Stauderman, 2003). The track configuration is often four-track stereo, where tracks 1 and 2 compose "Side A" and tracks 3 and 4 compose "Side B." Some home-recording enthusiasts may use a four-track recorder to create multi-track recordings. On these tapes, there are four tracks, all recorded in the same direction. Noise reduction technologies were developed in order to reduce the noise or tape hiss commonly found on thinner tapes recorded at slow speeds. Noise reduction technologies most commonly found on compact cassettes are Dolby (B, C, and S) and dbx (Type II). If a tape has been recorded using noise reduction, the playback equipment must have corresponding noise reduction capabilities in order to accurately play back the tape content. It is often very difficult to determine if a tape has been recorded with noise reduction without having documentation indicating so.</dd>
  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>The compact cassette was introduced in by Philips in the early 1960s. The gained popularity in the mid-1970s and prevailed until the mid-1990s when CDs and other digital formats began to supplant it in the marketplace.</dd>

  <dd>The 8-track cartridge (or Stereo 8) is a magnetic tape-based recorded sound format that was used exclusively for commercially releases (so therefore not likely to be unique).  The tape is composed of magnetic particles (or pigment), binder, and a polyester base (Stauderman, 2003). Ferric oxide is the most common pigment; other pigments include chromium dioxide, metal particle, and metal evaporated tape (Stauderman, 2003).

  <dt>Composition</dt>
  <dd>Polyester magnetic tape enclosed in a plastic cartridge</dd>
  <dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>As with other magnetic media, 8-tracks are susceptible to physical, biological, and chemical risks such as stretching, breaking, drop-outs, improper wind, mold, and binder deterioration. The format is also especially susceptible to tape binding due to lubrication loss and jamming in the playback machine.</dd>
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd>Eight-track media and playback equipment are long obsolete. Most recording companies discontinued the release of 8-track media by the early 1980s; the manufacture of playback equipment began to decline in the mid to late 1970s, as compact cassettes became more popular.</dd>
  <dt>Playback</dt>
  <dd>Eight-track tapes are recorded at a speed of 3.75 ips. The audio is recorded and played back in two-channel stereo with a tape track configuration of eight tracks, each in its own channel going in the same direction, making 4 sides (Stauderman, 2003). Since the tracks are so thin and close together and because the playback heads move between the pairs of tracks, the heads often become misaligned. When this misalignment occurs, echoes of adjacent tracks may be heard during playback. Specific playback equipment corresponding to the media is required to access the content.</dd>
  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>The Stereo-8 cartridge, more commonly known as the 8-track tape or 8-track, was developed by Bill Lear and was a popular format from the mid-1960s through the early 1980s. It evolved from the Muntz 4-track and Fidelipac cartridges. It gained its earliest popularity in the mid-1960s with RCA/Victor releasing commercial music on the format and Ford installing optional 8-track players on some of its automobiles. Eight-tracks were used mostly for commercial releases.</dd>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Digital Compact Cassette (DCC) is a magnetic tape-based moving image format. The tape is composed of magnetic particles (chromium dioxide- or cobalt- doped ferric-oxide) (Philips Electronics N.V., 1996), a binder, and a polyester base (Stauderman, 2003). DCC uses PASC (Precision Adaptive Sub-band Coding) compression in order to store the amount of information required for CD-quality sound on an audiotape. The cassette cartridge and tape width is the same as an analog compact cassette (approximately 4" × 2½" × ½" with a ⅛" tape). The cassettes look similar to analog audio cassettes except they only have access holes for the transport hubs on one side. Also, the tape path is shielded by a metal slider similar to those found on a 3.5 inch floppy disc.</dd>

  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>Digital Compact Cassettes (DCC) were introduced in the early 1990s. It was a format meant to supplant the analog audio tape and compete with MiniDisc and Digital Audio Tapes (DAT). Playback machines were backward-compatible; they supported playback for analog cassettes as well as DCC. It was a fairlypopular format in Europe. Philips discontinued manufacturing DCC tapes and playback in equipment in 1996, having lost the "format war" to MiniDisc.</dd>

<h2 id="magaudioconcerns">Magnetic Audio Playback</h2>
<h3>Tape Speed</h3>
<p>All tapes are recorded at a particular speed, measured in inches per second (ips), and must be played back at that speed for optimum audio quality. Generally, higher-speed recordings have better sound quality. Lower-speed tapes tend to have decreased high-frequency, which increases the amount of noise or tape hiss. More recently developed high-speed cassettes, however, employ noise-reduction technology, such as DBX or Dolby, to reduce tape hiss. The most common playback/record speeds are: 1⅞ ips, 3¾ ips, 7½ ips, 15 ips, and 30 ips.</p>
<h3>Tape Track Configuration</h3>
<p>In addition to format configurations (tapes that will only play back on the machine they were built for), there are tape track configurations, or layouts. It is often difficult to discern the tape track configuration of non-commercial and/or master tapes unless this information has been documented. Track configuration can also be determined by using a magnetic viewer such as the Arnold B-1022 (https://www.arnoldmagnetics.com/v2/sales/Product.aspx?id=238), which makes the signal recorded on the tape visible. It is essential that the playback head is the same configuration as the track to optimize playback; otherwise recording information is lost or represented incorrectly. Below is a list of the most common tape track configurations as applied most commonly to ¼" tape:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Full track</strong> (monaural): Has one track and one channel; is typically found on ¼" reel-to-reel tape but can pertain to any width tape.</li>
  <li><strong>Half track</strong> (also known as two track monaural): two tracks are recorded in opposite directions, with one channel each; is found on ¼" reel-to-reel and monaural cassettes.</li>
  <li><strong>Twin track</strong> (also known as "two-track" or "two-track stereo"): Two tracks are found going in the same direction, with each track as a channel; typically found on ¼" reel-to-reel, but can also be used as a half-track mono.</li>
  <li><strong>Quarter track</strong> (also known as four-track stereo): Four tracks are found in alternating directions: the 1st and 3rd tracks comprise "SIDE A" and the 2nd and 4th tracks comprise "SIDE B." Tape stock is ¼" wide. Note: channel 1 = side A left; channel 2 = side B left; channel 3 = side A right; channel 4 = side B right.</li>
  <li><strong>Four track</strong> (also known as four-track quad): There are four tracks, each going in the same direction and each comprising its own channel. Can be found in ¼" and ½" reel-to-reel. These should be left smoothly wound "tails out" (backwards), according to professional applications and environments.</li>
  <li><strong>Stereo cassette</strong> (Phillips, aka "standard format" or "compact cassette"): There are four tracks, with the 1st and 2nd tracks as "SIDE A" and the 3rd and 4th tracks as "SIDE B." Tape stock is ⅛" wide.</li>
  <li><strong>8-track stereo cartridge</strong>: There are eight tracks, each in its own channel and going in the same direction, making 4 sides. Tape stock is ¼" wide. Sixteen track is found on 1" and 2" reel-to-reel. Twenty-four track is found on 2" reel-to-reel (Stauderman, 2003).</li>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Acetate (cellulose acetate) was the early standard of magnetic audiotape recording (mid-1930s) through the 1950s, but seeing a temporarydecline during WWII and a slow phase-out beginning after the emergence of polyester in the 1950s. Manufacture of acetate-based audiotape continued until the early 1970s. These tapes, like acetate film, can suffer from acetate decay, or "vinegar syndrome," as well as shrinkage and brittleness. Unlike acetate film, acetate-based magnetic tapes cannot be frozen without causing damage to the information layer of the tape. Because of this, acetate decay cannot be halted. This, in addition to acetate's tensile weakness, is why the PSAP considers acetate-based tapes to be of the highest priority for reformatting and preservation.</dd>
  <dt>Identification</dt>
  <dd>You can identify acetate tape, particularly those produced post-WWII, by holding it in front of a light source. <em>If the tape pack appears to "glow" or pipe light, it is most likely acetate.</em> Note: the opposite is true for an acetate <em>film</em> pack.</dd>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Polyester (or PET,"Mylar") is the most common and stable base for audiotapes. Polyester is regarded as the lowest priority for reformatting and preservation. The polyester plasticizer itself is stable. However, the polyurethane binder typically used to carry magnetic particles on PET tapes is prone to "sticky shed syndrome" (binder hydrolysis) or the broader condition known as "soft binder syndrome" (Hess, 2008). This affects many 1970s–1980s polyester-based magnetic tapes. Degradation of the binder can result in gummy residues on tape heads during playback and can degrade cohesive strength to the point that the magnetic coating sheds on playback, resulting in absolute loss of recorded information.</dd>

<h3>Paper</h3>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>A rare base material, paper was used as the base layer in the second decade of magnetic audiotape, from the mid-1940s to the early 1950s in North America. This paper itself will be dull brown and faintly blotchy. As it is inherently old (perhaps 60+ years), paper-based magnetic audiotape can be very fragile and should be duplicated or digitized whenever possible. Considering that and the obscurity of paper tape, in terms of priority, paper ranks slightly lower than acetate.</dd>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>PVC (or polyvinyl chloride, Luvitherm) is a relatively obscure base layer for magnetic audiotape as it was produced primarily in Germany (mainly by BASF) from 1943 to 1972, but ebbed in the 1960s as polyester-backed tapes rose in favor. Like polyester, PVC has tensile strength; it will stretch under stress rather than break like acetate. However, PVC-based magnetic tape is unstable, with inherent plasticizer issues. Under repeated use, the binder can shed magnetic iron oxide particles (this is called pinholing). Though PVC-based tape is unreliable, it still ranks between polyester and acetate in terms of preservation priority (Hess, 2008). </dd>
  <dt>Identification</dt>
  <dd>It is difficult to distinguish PVC from polyester tape. A PVC tape pack will appear opaque in front of light like polyester, so the best method of identification is through manufacturer and dating the media. Beyond BASF, other PVC tape manufacturers might include IG Farben (1940s), Agfa (late 1950s), and 3M (Scotch 311, around 1960). But keep in mind that PVC is relatively rare, especially outside of Europe.</dd>
