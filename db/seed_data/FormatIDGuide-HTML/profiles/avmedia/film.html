The National Film Preservation Foundation's (NFPF) guide (2004) states that "for each film gauge there is a family of like-gauged equipment and supplies designed to work together. Manufacturers make the film stock with holes (known as perforations), usually along the edges, to advance the film strip through the sprockets of same-gauged cameras and projectors" (p.6).

    <p>Film incurs the most physical wear through playback, typically at the beginning and end of the film. Films can become stuck in the projector or misalign with the take-up sprockets, causing sprocket holes to tear and other serious damage.

We highly recommend having a skilled technician perform a thorough inspection of the film and playback equipment prior to projecting the film.</p>

  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>Thirty-five millimeter film gauge (width) was first developed in 1893 and is still in use today. Films produced before the 1950s may use flammable cellulose nitrate as their plastic base and should be treated and stored with great care. Motion picture films produced after the 1950s may use cellulose acetate or polyester as their base. Cellulose acetate has a characteristic kind of breakdown known colloquially as "vinegar syndrome." Polyester is a very stable plastic; if stored properly, films with this base can have very long viable lives.</dd>

  <dt>Storage Enclosure(s)</dt>
  <dd>
  <p><b>Container:</b> Film is ideally stored in a vented inert plastic can. Vents allow the film to “breathe” an even air exchange (crucial for acetate). The enclosure may be plastic, non-corrosive metal, or archival quality paperboard. Dirty, rusty, non-vented, or dented metal containers will only heighten the potential for film damage. The container your institution uses will largely depend upon the environment.</p>
  <p>If storing film in a room temperature environment, vented containers composed of polypropylene or polyethylene are optimal. If you are storing your film in freezing temperatures, your cans should be sealed and moisture-resistant. In any case, cans should be clean and free from debris, rust and structural damage (NFPF, 2004).
When freezing film ensure that the the film is properly housed by double-bagging it in zip-sealed freezer bags.</p>
<p><b>Core:</b> Film should be stored on a core (rather than on a reel), ideally an inert plastic core. For 16mm and 35mm, the National Film Preservation Foundation (NFPF) recommends that the core be at least 3 inches wide. A wider core diameter lessens stress on the film as the film will not be wound as tightly. Smaller film gauges may be wound on smaller (less than 3") cores. A core is distinct from a reel. A reel is a "metal or plastic hub with extended sides between which the film is wound for projection" (NFPF, p. 106). Reels—especially metal, dented, or otherwise damaged reels—are NOT appropriate for long-term storage.</p>
</dd>
  <dt>Storage Orientation</dt>
  <dd>
  <p>Film should be stored stacked horizontally. Because of its considerable weight and the way that it is wound, it is best to store film flat and on an inert plastic core. Doing so will allow the film to maintain an even, rounded shape. Stacking film on reels without a film canister of some kind is not recommended because the reels will, over time, be compressed and can press into the film itself.</p>
  <p>Store acetate film separately from other materials so to mitigate the effects of acetic acid decomposition (e.g. off-gassing).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Handling/Care</dt>
  <dd>
  <p>Always wear gloves (nitrile or cotton) when handling film. Cotton gloves may be problematic if the film has many tape splices or fragile edges/sprocket holes. Handle only by the edges. If you touch the film image or soundtrack without gloves, you will leave fingerprints. Assume the film is easily torn, regardless of base material; take care whenever handling it. Never leave media in a playback machine; always return to storage enclosure when not in use.</p>
  <p>If you are interested in freezing infrequently accessed materials, refer to <a href="http://www.filmforever.org/" target="_blank">The Home Film Preservation Guide</a> (sec. 8) for detailed steps on how prepare your film for long-term freezing (NFPF, 2004).</p>

  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>The Super 8mm film gauge was first developed by Kodak in the mid-1960s and is still in use today. This film format can be distinguished from regular 8mm film by its larger image area and smaller sprocket holes. Super 8mm film is found with acetate or polyester plastic bases. Cellulose acetate has a characteristic kind of breakdown known colloquially as "vinegar syndrome." Polyester is a very stable plastic, and if stored properly, films with this base can have very long viable lives.</dd>

<dt>Storage Enclosure(s)</dt>
  <dd>
  <p><b>Container:</b> Film is ideally stored in a vented inert plastic can. Vents allow the film to “breathe” an even air exchange (crucial for acetate). The enclosure may be plastic, non-corrosive metal, or archival quality paperboard. Dirty, rusty, non-vented, or dented metal containers will only heighten the potential for film damage. The container your institution uses will largely depend upon the environment.</p>
  <p>If storing film in a room temperature environment, vented containers composed of polypropylene or polyethylene are optimal. If you are storing your film in freezing temperatures, your cans should be sealed and moisture-resistant. In any case, cans should be clean and free from debris, rust and structural damage (NFPF, 2004).
When freezing film ensure that the the film is properly housed by double-bagging it in zip-sealed freezer bags.</p>
<p><b>Core:</b> Film should be stored on a core (rather than on a reel), ideally an inert plastic core. For larger film gauges, the National Film Preservation Foundation (NFPF) recommends that the core be at least 3 inches wide. A wider core diameter lessens stress on the film as the film will not be wound as tightly. Smaller film gauges may be wound on smaller (less than 3") cores. A core is distinct from a reel. A reel is a "metal or plastic hub with extended sides between which the film is wound for projection" (NFPF, p. 106). Reels—especially metal, dented, or otherwise damaged reels—are NOT appropriate for long-term storage.</p>

  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>Pathé introduced this film format in 1921. By the end of that decade, 9.5mm had risen in popularity across the European amateur film market, where it held on until the 1950s, when 8mm film emerged as the commerical victor. Most projectors were hand-cranked. Sound was introduced in the 1930s. 9.5mm never caught on in the United States. The film format typically has a cellulose acetate plastic base, which has a characteristic kind of breakdown known colloquially as "vinegar syndrome."</dd>

<h2 id="filmbase">Film Base Materials</h2>
<p>Film formats are composed of two layers: the emulsion layer, which supports the photosensitive material and the thicker transparent plastic base, which supports the emulsion layer. The base is generally composed of one of three types of plastic: nitrate, acetate or polyester. Bases may be identified based on a few factors. Date can be an important indicator, as can film gauge. Of the three materials, nitrate is the oldest, most volatile and requires the most care in handling. A form of acetate film was introduced in 1909. It was developed to circumvent the danger of nitrate, but is subject to its own particular kind of decay.</p>

<h3>Identifying Film Base</h3>
<p>To positively identify the film base, you may have to partially unspool the film. Unspooling film is not without risk. If you are unable or unwilling to unspool your film and you have no supporting information to inform your decision(s), we recommend you click on "Unsure" when faced with this question in the PSAP.</p>

<p>When we talk about film base, we are talking about the plastic layer that is the carrier for the emulsion layer (the image layer) of film.</p>

<h3 id="filmnitrate">Nitrate</h3>
<p>Most 35mm film bases prior to the early 1950s are composed of cellulose nitrate (nitrate). Nitrate is a highly flammable material, with nitrate fires being nearly impossible to extinguish one they've started. It can ignite at relatively low temperatures—ranging from 300°F to 105°F in later stages of decay. In the 1920s, Kodak began labeling nitrate film by printing "NITRATE" on the edge of the film.</p>

  <li>Nitrate is found in 35mm gauge (and rare amateur formats not featured here)</li>
  <li>Nitrate odor is often described as the smell of dirty socks</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="filmacetate">Acetate</h3>
<p>Acetate, in various chemical forms ranging from cellulose diacetate in 1909 to cellulose triacetate in the 1940s, was an improvement over nitrate in that flammability was greatly reduced. Hence, acetate films became to be known as "safety film". Manufacturers identified their film as safety by labeling it as such. The text "SAFETY" is often printed edge of early acetate film.</p>

<figure><img src="images/safetyedgeprinting.jpg" alt="Safety film" data-has-retina="yes"><figcaption>Film base clearly identified as SAFETY.</figcaption></figure>
</div>

<p> An additional way to identify acetate is to place the film pack parallel to a light source. If light CANNOT be seen piping through the film strands, it is most likely an acetate-base film. The film will appear opaque and light will not filter through the film pack. Acetate film can be found in a variety of gauges: 35mm, 28mm, 16mm, 9.5mm, regular 8mm, and Super 8mm.</p>

  <li>Acetate is found in 35mm, 16mm, 8mm and Super 8 gauges</li>
  <li>Acetate, if it is suffering from acetate decay, will often emit an vinegar odor</li>
  <li>Store acetate film separately from other materials so to mitigate the effects of acetic acid decomposition (e.g. off-gassing).</li>
  <li>The easiest way to differentiate acetate base film from polyester base film is to hold the film up to the light (see below for an image). If it appears to be fairly opaque, it is acetate (Note: the reverse is true of magnetic audiotape)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="filmpolyester">Polyester</h3>
<p>Polyester is the most recently developed film base. It was developed in the mid-1950s, and continues to be the standard for film-to-film archival preservation because of its durability. It cannot be easily torn, and is chemically very stable. You can identify a polyester film base by piping light upwards through, and parallel to a horizontally-oriented film pack. If the pack appears to "pipe" light; that is, light can be seen through the film pack, the film is polyester-based.</p>

<div class="figure-gallery">

<ul>
<li>Polyester film is the lowest preservation priority</li>
  <li>The easiest way to differentiate acetate base film from polyester base film is to hold the film up to the light (see below for an image). If light easily passes through the film pack, the film is polyester. If it appears to be fairly opaque, it is acetate (Note: the reverse is true of magnetic audiotape)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="filmsoundtrack">Sound on Film: Soundtracks</h2>

<p>To determine the soundtrack type, partially unspooling the film will likely be necessary; this is not without risk.</p>

<p>A soundtrack on film is often identified by a continuous stripe running along the length of the film. It looks considerably different than the film picture frames. The strip may be a reddish-brown color (a <em>magnetic</em>, or mag, soundtrack). Or it may look like two strips which contain similar wavy forms (a <em>variable area optical</em> soundtrack) or it may look like a gray strip of varying darkness (a <em>variable density optical</em> soundtrack).</p>

<div class="figure-gallery">

</div>

<p>The soundtrack may not be on the film but could be a separate, individual element. For example, some film makers create a full-coat mag, which is "a production or preservation element (a part of a entire production) in which the magnetic oxide recording layer covers one full side of the film surface" (FPG, p. 102).</p>

</div>

<p>If your film does not have a soundtrack and it is a 35mm or 16mm, you may want to seek out production notes to determine if there are any additional sound elements. As advised in the Film Preservation Guide, preservationists should watch for commentary, dialog or music recorded on a separate audiotape reel or cassette intended to be played with the film during screening, with amateur and avant-garde films in particular.</p>
