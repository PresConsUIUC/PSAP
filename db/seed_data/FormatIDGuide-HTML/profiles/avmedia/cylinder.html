<h1>Grooved Cylinder</h1>
<p>This audio format type consists of a grooved phonograph cylinder composed of wax or plastic. The sound information is inscribed as grooves along the cylinder exterior and is played back with a needle or stylus. Cylinders were commerically available from the late 1880s through the late 1920s.</p>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>A wax cylinder is an analog recording sound format that consists of a mechanical grooved cylinder made of soft wax. The earliest wax cylinders are ivory or cream colored, while subsequent wax cylinders are a warm medium brown color. The "standard" cylinder dimensions are typically 2¼" in diameter and 4–4¼" in length, although they vary widely, ranging from 1⅓" diameter × 4" length, 2¼" diameter × 8" length, 3¾" diameter by 6" length, and 5" diameter × 4" length.</dd>
  <dt>Composition</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Molded wax cylinder with or without cardboard core.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>All grooved cylinder media is susceptible to warpage, breakage, groove wear, and surface contamination. Surface contamination includes dirt, dust, mold, and other foreign materials—all of which can abrade or damage the grooves and diminish playback sound quality. Wax cylinders are especially prone to issues related to humid storage environments, namely fungal growth. Additionally, materials within the wax cylinder harden with age, causing the wax to become brittle. The surface of wax cylinders is soft and fragile, and they are also prone to surface scratching and groove wear.</dd>
  
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd>Cylinders should be given priority for reformatting because of the age, fragility, obsolenscence, and relative uniqueness of their content.</dd>
  <dt>Playback</dt>
  <dd>Cylinders require format-specific machines for playback.  Cylinders of different diameters cannot be played on the same machine; and, attempting to do so will damage the cylinder. The earliest wax cylinders are typically 2 to 2.5 minutes in length with 100 grooves per inch. Playback speed is also a consideration, since cylinders have different rotation speeds depending on the manufacturer and technology. Rotation speeds include 120 rpm, 144 rpm, and 160 rpm.</dd>
  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>Cylinders are the earliest manufactured recorded sound format. They were developed by Thomas Edison in 1877 and remained in commercial production until 1929. Cylinder recording technology was still used from the 1930s until the early 1960s for ethnographic field recording notes and office dictation.</dd>

  <dd>Cylinders should be stored standing on their ends like a drinking glass.</dd>
  <dt>Handling/Care</dt>

If you must handle, insert two (or more) fingers into the cylinder interior and then use your other palm to support the bottom edge.
