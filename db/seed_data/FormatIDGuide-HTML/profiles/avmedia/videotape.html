  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Two-inch open reel (or "quad") is a magnetic tape-based analog video format. The tape is composed of magnetic particles, a binder, and a polyester base (Forgas, 1997). The reel is approximately 12" inches in diameter. The shipping container for this format is easily identifiable due to its sheer size, at 15" square × 4", weighing up to 20–30 lbs. Two-inch open reels may also be found in cardboard boxes (Texas Commission on the Arts, 2004). The containers often hold extensive labeling information.</dd>

<li>
<b>Paper/Paperboard:</b> Neutral pH, lignin-free, buffered materials recommended.</li>
</ul>
<p>The container should support the reel by the hub so to preserve the tape pack and prevent distortion of the tape. Use unslotted reels if possible. It is also recommended that you use acid-free archival hold-down tape to secure loose ends of the open reel tape.</p>
<p>Whenever feasible, replace original cardboard containers as they are typically non-archival (acidic) and have meager or no hub support. When inspecting older 1" and 2" open reel tape containers, be sure to check the inside of the container for debris. Open reel shipping containers often have a spongy lining that deteriorates over time into a powdery and then gummy substance that is very difficult to clean. This can cause damage to the surface of the tape. If you encounter this situation, place the tape (after thorough inspection) into a clean container. An enclosure must be truly clean so to protect the fragile tape surface; dust and dirt abrasions can affect playback quality and even render it unplayable.

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Half-inch open reel is a magnetic tape-based analog video format. The tape is composed of magnetic particles, a binder, and a polyester base (Forgas, 1997). The most common containers for smaller tapes are approximately 5½" × 5½" × 1" in size and are made of a soft or hard plastic. Larger reels will be in containers approximately 8⅜" × 8⅜" × 1¼" in size. The plastic container may also be inside of a separate paperboard sleeve. There are other containers that are approximately the same size but have handles. Commonly used reels are 5" in diameter or 7¼" in diameter (Texas Commission on the Arts, 2004). </dd>

Half-inch open reel tapes are known to have problems with sticky shed syndrome (Texas Commission on the Arts, 2004). </dd>
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd>Half-inch open reel tapes should be reformatted by a vendor with proven experience with this format. The media is obsolete and playback equipment is exceptionally difficult to come by, especially in working order. This format is especially vulnerable and, based on content assessment, should be prioritized for reformatting. </dd>
  <dt>Playback</dt>
  <dd>Each audiovisual medium requires equipment to decode the information held within it. There are two common ½" tape versions—CV and AV (EIAJ Type 1). They look the same, but will play back on different decks. CV tapes were manufactured beginning in 1965; AV was introduced in 1969. The tape reels are typically made from translucent plastic. The Sony tape containers are typically black and will say "For helical scan video recorders" (Texas Commission on the Arts, 2004). </dd>
  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>Developed for the industrial, educational, and consumer markets, half-inch open reel was introduced in 1965 and was used primarily for in-studio recording until approximately the late 1970s, when it was gradually replaced by cassette formats. It was also used as a format for preservation masters beginning in the late 1980s and early 1990s (Texas Commission on the Arts, 2004). Smaller reels were used in the first portable video recorders, or "portapaks," and larger reels were typically used for stationary recording and/or video editing. </dd>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>U-matic is a magnetic tape-based analog video format. The tape is composed of magnetic particles, a binder, and a polyester base (Forgas, 1997). Full-size cassettes are 8⅝" × 5⅜" × 1⅕" and small cassettes are 7¼" × 4⅝" × 1⅕" (Texas Commission on the Arts, 2004). The full-sized cassettes can record up to 60 minutes of content whereas the smaller cassettes hold up to 20 minutes. The picture quality of SP is superior to standard U-matic; however, although the SP tapes can be played back in a standard deck, the improvement in picture quality is lost. Standard U-matic tapes cannot be played back on a SP deck. </dd>

  <dd>Each audiovisual medium requires equipment to decode the information held within it. </dd>
  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>Standard U-matic was introduced in 1971 and SP was introduced in 1986. The format was primarily developed for industrial and education markets. In the 1970s and 1980s, it was widely used for electronic news gathering, and up through the 1990s, it was a primary format for many artists, community activists, academic institutions, and production houses. Many artist and community videos are in this format; it was a preferred format for edit masters in the 1980s (Texas Commission on the Arts, 2004). </dd>

  <dt>Storage Enclosure(s)</dt>
  <dd>
  <p>Acid-free enclosures are strongly advised. Each item should have its own enclosure to protect it from dust, handling damage, and changes in environmental conditions. All storage materials should pass the Photographic Activity Test (PAT) as specified in ISO Standard 18916:2007. In all, this means they must be chemically and physically stable:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Plastics:</b> Polyethylene, polypropylene or polyester (a.k.a. Mylar D or Melinex 516). No PVC or acetate.</li>
<li>
<b>Paper/Paperboard:</b> Neutral pH, lignin-free, buffered materials recommended.</li>
</ul>
<p>Inert plastic containers are ideal. If housed in a plastic container and you are unsure if it is inert or is acceptable, check the condition of the container. If it is protecting the media from dust, pests, and other contaminants, not shedding or introducing any contaminants through its own degradation, and is clean and free of mold or excessive dirt, the container is acceptable. Anything other than a hard plastic container, e.g. a cardboard or thin plastic slipcover, or is not sufficiently protected, it should be rehoused in a clean, inert plastic container.</p>
<p>An enclosure must be truly clean so to protect the fragile tape surface; dust and dirt abrasions can affect sound quality and even render it unplayable. Moldy, damaged, and dirty containers must be replaced.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Storage Orientation</dt>
  <dd>The best orientation for a cassette is vertical (on its end). Cassettes and cartridges, generally speaking, like to be stored upright on shelves like books. Piling tapes one upon the other tends to stress the cassettes at bottom; this can, over time, cause the plastic housing to warp and even crack. Even allowing cassettes to lean for too long in a suboptimal environment could lead to distortion.</dd>
  <dt>Handling/Care</dt>
  <dd>Engage the record protection mechanism if it has not already been done (see Record Protection). Do not attempt to open a tape cassette/cartridge; this is likely to cause greater damage unless you know what you are doing. Furthermore, never touch the magnetic tape surface. Keep magnetic media away from stray electromagnetic fields; avoid devices with a motor or transformer, all of which generate an alternating magnetic field. Never leave media in a playback machine; always return to storage enclosure when not in use.</dd>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Betacam and Betacam SP is a magnetic tape-based analog video format. The tape is composed of magnetic particles, a binder, and a polyester base (Forgas, 1997). Large cassette cases are 10⅝" × 6⅜" × 1¼". Small cassette cases are 6¾" × 4⅜" × 1⅕". Tape cassettes are generally labeled (as "Betacam" or "Betacam SP") in the upper right-hand corner (Texas Commission on the Arts, 2004). </dd>
  <dt>Composition</dt>
  <dd>Polyester magnetic tape enclosed in a plastic cassette</dd>
  <dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>Older Betacam tapes are susceptible to signal loss due to age. Tapes are also susceptible to damage from mold, binder deterioration, and other physical and biological issues. Equipment obsolescence is not yet a concern as Betacam SP and Digital Betacam decks are still in production and can play back a variety of Beta cassettes.</dd>
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd>Playback equipment for this format is still available and the cassettes tend to be durable, so most risk is related to age. This format would currently be considered low risk. </dd>
  <dt>Playback</dt>
  <dd>Each audiovisual medium requires equipment to decode the information held within it. </dd>
  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>Betacam was introduced in 1982 and Betacam SP was introduced in 1986. Betacam SP has technical advantages over Betacam and is "upwardly compatible"; that is, Betacam tapes are playable on Betacam SP decks, but tapes recorded in Betacam SP ARE NOT playable on Betacam decks. Decks for Betacam and Betacam SP are no longer in production. However, most newer decks in the Betacam family, such as Digital Betacam and Betacam SX decks, will play Betacam SP tapes, though this equipment, too, is in increasingly short supply. </dd>

<dt>Storage Enclosure(s)</dt>
  <dd>
  <p>Acid-free enclosures are strongly advised. Each item should have its own enclosure to protect it from dust, handling damage, and changes in environmental conditions. All storage materials should pass the Photographic Activity Test (PAT) as specified in ISO Standard 18916:2007. In all, this means they must be chemically and physically stable:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Plastics:</b> Polyethylene, polypropylene or polyester (a.k.a. Mylar D or Melinex 516). No PVC or acetate.</li>
<li>
<b>Paper/Paperboard:</b> Neutral pH, lignin-free, buffered materials recommended.</li>
</ul>
<p>Inert plastic containers are ideal. If housed in a plastic container and you are unsure if it is inert or is acceptable, check the condition of the container. If it is protecting the media from dust, pests, and other contaminants, not shedding or introducing any contaminants through its own degradation, and is clean and free of mold or excessive dirt, the container is acceptable. Anything other than a hard plastic container, e.g. a cardboard or thin plastic slipcover, or is not sufficiently protected, it should be rehoused in a clean, inert plastic container.</p>
<p>An enclosure must be truly clean so to protect the fragile tape surface; dust and dirt abrasions can affect sound quality and even render it unplayable. Moldy, damaged, and dirty containers must be replaced.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Storage Orientation</dt>
  <dd>The best orientation for a cassette is vertical (on its end). Cassettes and cartridges, generally speaking, like to be stored upright on shelves like books. Piling tapes one upon the other tends to stress the cassettes at bottom; this can, over time, cause the plastic housing to warp and even crack. Even allowing cassettes to lean for too long in a suboptimal environment could lead to distortion.</dd>
  <dt>Handling/Care</dt>
  <dd>Engage the record protection mechanism if it has not already been done (see Record Protection). Do not attempt to open a tape cassette/cartridge; this is likely to cause greater damage unless you know what you are doing. Furthermore, never touch the magnetic tape surface. Keep magnetic media away from stray electromagnetic fields; avoid devices with a motor or transformer, all of which generate an alternating magnetic field. Never leave media in a playback machine; always return to storage enclosure when not in use.</dd>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Digital Betacam is a magnetic tape-based digital video format. The tape is composed of magnetic particles, a binder, and a polyester base (Forgas, 1997). Large cassettes are 9⅓" × 5⅔" × 1" and are used in recording and editing decks, and have an available recording length of about 194 minutes. Small cassettes measure 6⅛" × 3¾" × 1", are used in cameras, and have an available recording length of 64 minutes (Texas Commission on the Arts, 2004). The cassettes are usually a light grayish blue in color with "Digital Betacam" printed on the upper right-hand corner and "for Digital" in the upper left-hand corner. </dd>
  <dt>Composition</dt>
  <dd>Polyester magnetic tape enclosed in a plastic cassette</dd>
  <dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>Digital Betacam is subject to the same physical issues as analog tape—stretching, breaking, drop-outs, mold, binder deterioration, and unintended recording. Presently, market share and the production of backward-compatible playback decks seem to suggest a lesser threat to obsolescence compared to other formats. However, as with any newer video format, it is difficult to predict how long it will be supported (Texas Commission on the Arts, 2004). </dd>
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd>As with most magnetic media, Digital Betacam is subject to the threat of obsolescence; however, its present market share suggests that this threat is low. Digital Betacam is considered the best choice for preservation masters and thus is envisioned as mitigating risks, rather than being subject to them. </dd>
  <dt>Playback</dt>
  <dd>Each audiovisual medium requires equipment to decode the information held within it. </dd>
  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>Digital Betacam, which was developed for the professional market, was introduced in 1993. It is still in use, particularly in industrial and professional sectors, though it has never reached the industry support of it's predecessor, Betacam SP. For some time, DigiBeta was used for video preservation masters in broadcast archives. </dd>

The DVCPro logo is usually in the upper right-hand corner, and the tape length is generally listed on the left-hand corner.

  <dd>Although these formats are relatively new, they are especially fragile and are not recommended for long-term storage. ME tapes are especially prone to durability problems. Depending on the intellectual content, it is recommended that these formats receive reformatting priority. </dd>
  <dt>Playback</dt>
  <dd>Each audiovisual medium requires equipment to decode the information held within it. </dd>
  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>Video8 was introduced in 1984 and Hi8 came soon after in 1989. Video8 was developed for the consumer market, whereas Hi8 was geared toward consumer, industrial, and educational markets (Texas Commission on the Arts, 2004). Hi8 has technical advantages over Video8 and is "upwardly compatible"; that is, Hi8 tapes are playable on Video8 decks, but tapes recorded in Video8 ARE NOT playable on Hi8 decks (Texas Commission on the Arts, 2004). Decks for both formats are no longer being produced and are increasingly rare. Supplanted by Digital8 (a forgotten competitor to MiniDV), Hi8 camcorders were commercially available until 2007, the same year that Digital8 camcorders and decks were discontinued. </dd>

<dt>Storage Enclosure(s)</dt>
  <dd>
  <p>Acid-free enclosures are strongly advised. Each item should have its own enclosure to protect it from dust, handling damage, and changes in environmental conditions. All storage materials should pass the Photographic Activity Test (PAT) as specified in ISO Standard 18916:2007. In all, this means they must be chemically and physically stable:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Plastics:</b> Polyethylene, polypropylene or polyester (a.k.a. Mylar D or Melinex 516). No PVC or acetate.</li>
<li>
<b>Paper/Paperboard:</b> Neutral pH, lignin-free, buffered materials recommended.</li>
</ul>
<p>Inert plastic containers are ideal. If housed in a plastic container and you are unsure if it is inert or is acceptable, check the condition of the container. If it is protecting the media from dust, pests, and other contaminants, not shedding or introducing any contaminants through its own degradation, and is clean and free of mold or excessive dirt, the container is acceptable. Anything other than a hard plastic container, e.g. a cardboard or thin plastic slipcover, or is not sufficiently protected, it should be rehoused in a clean, inert plastic container.</p>
<p>An enclosure must be truly clean so to protect the fragile tape surface; dust and dirt abrasions can affect sound quality and even render it unplayable. Moldy, damaged, and dirty containers must be replaced.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Storage Orientation</dt>
  <dd>The best orientation for a cassette is vertical (on its end). Cassettes and cartridges, generally speaking, like to be stored upright on shelves like books. Piling tapes one upon the other tends to stress the cassettes at bottom; this can, over time, cause the plastic housing to warp and even crack. Even allowing cassettes to lean for too long in a suboptimal environment could lead to distortion.</dd>
  <dt>Handling/Care</dt>
  <dd>Engage the record protection mechanism if it has not already been done (see Record Protection). Do not attempt to open a tape cassette/cartridge; this is likely to cause greater damage unless you know what you are doing. Furthermore, never touch the magnetic tape surface. Keep magnetic media away from stray electromagnetic fields; avoid devices with a motor or transformer, all of which generate an alternating magnetic field. Never leave media in a playback machine; always return to storage enclosure when not in use.</dd>
