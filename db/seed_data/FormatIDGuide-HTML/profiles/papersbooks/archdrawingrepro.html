<body>
<h1>Architectural Drawing Reproduction</h1>
<p>Before the 1870s, architectural and technical drawing copies were produced by hand using translucent tracing paper or drafting cloth. In the mid-1870s blueprinting was introduced to the architectural and engineering professions in North America, and quickly gained popularity. Many new photo-reproductive processes followed using a variety of light sensitive materials, paper and cloth supports, and processing methods. Many of the processes used to strike prints from drawings were also used in other commercial applications (e.g. office reprographics). These prints were produced by photo-reproductive and photomechanical methods.</p>
<p>A majority of architectural drawings—and copies of them—are "oversize," that is, large enough that they exceed average storage spaces. As a result, oversized materials are often found folded, rolled, or in flat file cabinets (ideally). The source of oversize papers' problems is their unwieldiness, which makes them susceptible to damage through handling and subpar storage.</p>

<ul>
<li>Dates found on prints may be misleading. Unless the date is hand-written or stamped directly on the print, it is quite possible that the date the print was created does not coincide with the date found on the print; the date may instead reflect when the original drawing was produced.</li>
  <li>When identifying support materials, bear in mind that prints on paper are often found mounted on muslin cloth (19th–early 20th century), cardboard, Masonite (fiberboard), and foam-core.</li>
  <li>If format identification is unsuccessful, you may select "Unidentified" to perform a more generalized PSAP assessment of the architectural drawing reproduction.</li>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Aniline prints are always positive images. The image ground may be slightly flecked, but is overall a slight greenish or yellow-beige tint. The green of the ground is the sensitized coating on the paper. The verso (back) will be lighter (even white), the color of the support material. Like other aniline dye processes, the image/text is of low-contrast, with soft lines. Image lines also appear to be deeply embedded within the support when viewed under magnification. The print may include additional coloring achieved through watercolor. Aniline prints will resemble diazo prints but predate them by about 25 to 50 years.</dd>

</dd>
<dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>Aniline images will fade on exposure to light. The surface may exhibit white scratches, scuffs, and cracks, due to residual acids in the print. Paper supports will often be brittle and cloth supports limp due to the presence of residual and oftentimes acidic chemicals.</dd>
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd>Moderate. UV light exposure is the primary risk to aniline prints, causing severe image fading. High temperature and high humidity will accelerate print deterioration. Residual chemicals will exacerbate breakdown, causing structural degradation and yellowing. Due to the acidic nature of aniline prints, they should be segregated from other collection materials and stored in pH neutral enclosures.</dd>
  <dt>Process</dt>
  <dd>A support is sensitized by floating one side in an aniline chemical compound solution (including chromic salts) and set to dry in a dark environment. This sensitized support is then placed under an translucent master document/drawing and exposed to strong UV light: the master is used like a photographic negative, in which light is blocked in dark (lines/text) areas and allowed to pass through light (whitespace) areas. The image is then developed through the copy’s exposure to aniline fumes, which produces a positive image when it it interacts with the chromic salts. The aniline print is then rinsed in an acidic bath to remove excess compounds.</dd>
  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>Introduced as a drawing and writing reprographic process in 1864, aniline prints rose in public favor quickly due to its relatively fast drying ink. Alongside the hectographic process, aniline printing was one of the most common processes for technical/architectural drawing reproductions before being supplanted by the blueprint at the end of the 19th century. A derivative aniline process branded as "flexography" was adopted in the 1940s for printing flexible product packaging.</dd>

  <dt>Storage Enclosure(s)</dt>
  <dd>
  <p>Technical prints were generally not made with long-term stability in mind; most were created quickly and cheaply to serve an ephemeral, utilitarian purpose. As a result, many technical prints may retain chemical residues from processing. These residual chemicals may off-gas or cause damage if placed in contact with other prints.</p>
  <p>Technical prints are usually large and may be stored horizontally in flat files or rolled. Enameled steel, stainless steel, or anodized aluminum flat files are preferred. Store different types of technical prints separately in order to prevent contact degradation. Alkaline storage enclosures are not advised for aniline prints due to the pH sensitivity of aniline dye. Folders cut to drawer size are recommended, with less than 12 prints to a folder, interleaving sheets placed between them (both neutral pH). Individual prints may be stored in polyester sleeves within folders in order to protect particularly fragile items or to separate formats from one another. Polyester sleeves also provide additional support during handling.</p>
  <p>If space for flat storage is not available, it may be acceptable to store the prints rolled. Brittle or otherwise fragile prints should not be rolled. Prints that are strong and flexible enough to be rolled must have an interior support: a neutral pH cardboard tube (over 3" diameter) itself wrapped in polyester or neutral paper. The rolled print (and interior support) may be wrapped in the neutral paper or polyester and stored horizontally, not upright. Prints should not be folded; this will create fold lines which weaken the paper and cause it to tear. All storage materials should pass the Photographic Activity Test (PAT) as specified in ISO Standard 18916:2007.</p>

  <dd>Ferro-gallic prints are always positive images: dark lines on a light-colored ground. Though the lines were dark blue-black at the time of their creation, they are usually found faded to brown or dull black. Paper fibers are visible under low magnification. Under magnification, the image lines may either appear raised or burned into the paper surface, depending upon the method of production. Ferro-gallic prints were conventionally used as studies or process prints, and may have additional media and marginalia (Kissel &amp; Vigneau, 1999).</dd>

</dd>

<dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>Ferro-gallic prints are unstable due to the presence of acid in the support which remains after processing. As a result the support is likely to be brittle and yellowed. The lines, made up of ferric gallotannate, are also acidic and may cause lacing of the paper support. Ferro-gallic prints are sensitive to light and the image lines may become brown, fade, or disappear completely. They should not be stored in contact with other prints, as the acidic prints may damage adjacent objects.</dd>
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd>Moderately high. Ferro-gallic prints are highly acidic, frequently brittle, and very sensitive to light. The image material, like iron gall ink, is acidic and may degrade the paper support to the point of eating through it. Store in the dark in unsealed, pH neutral, unbuffered enclosures or dividers. Keep them away from other collection materials so to curb the negative effects of acidic off-gassing.</dd>
  <dt>Process</dt>
  <dd>Ferro-gallic prints may be sensitized in one of two ways. Prior to 1900, the support was simply coated with a gum arabic or gelatin solution containing ferric salts. After 1900, the acidic developer was incorporated into the ferric salt-and-gelatin solution. Despite this difference, the process remained the same. The sensitized paper is then placed beneath a translucent master document/drawing and exposed to strong UV light: the master is used like a photographic negative, in which light is blocked in dark (lines/text) areas and allowed to pass through light (whitespace) areas. As light exposes the ferric salts, the gelatin (or gum arabic) in these unblocked areas become water soluble. The paper is then washed in water, releasing the acidic developer, turning the ferric salts into a ferric gallotannate pigment, while removing the gelatin (or gum arabic) and residual ferric salts. The resulting image is qualitatively (and nearly chemically) the same as iron gall ink.</dd>
  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>The ferro-gallic process was originally developed in 1860. It was mostly used in Europe and was phased out in the 1930s in favor of cheaper and more practical processes such as the diazo print. Despite being more expensive and difficult than blueprinting, ferro-gallic prints were preferred by some for a few specific purposes. The process was useful for producing clean copies of tracings, since the process allows corrections to be made during processing. Additionally, the ferro-gallic process produces the most ink-like lines of technical/architectural drawing reproduction processes, allowing the production of imitation ink drawing multiples, which proved valuable for technical drawings.</dd>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>A blueprint is a single-layer print comprised of a blue pigment embedded in an uncoated paper (or cloth) fibers. The ground color is a brilliant "Prussian" blue with continuous tone. The paper fibers are clearly visible and paper (or cloth) texture will likely be rough. Surface finish is extremely matte with no surface gloss due to the absence of a binder layer. Most blueprints are negatives, with white image/text lines on a dark blue background, but sometimes positive images were also created to allow for easier reading. These positive prints (dark blue lines on a light ground) were known as pellet prints. The verso (back) of either type of print will likely be white or off-white (or color of the support paper/cloth).</dd>

</dd>
<dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>Blueprints are very sensitive to light, but are otherwise quite stable if kept in dark storage. Faded blueprints may regain substantial image density when kept in dark storage. Paper distortion is a common quality that results from the blueprint wet process. Some slight overall unevenness of the paper is not necessarily a deteriorative trait.</dd>
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd>Moderately low. Blueprints are relatively stable and image permanent if kept in dark storage conditions and out of an alkaline pH environment. The integrity of the support paper is often the decisive factor in the long term preservation of blueprints.</dd>
  <dt>Process</dt>
  <dd>A sheet of heavy paper (or cloth) sensitized with ferric ammonium citrate and potassium ferricyanide is exposed using sunlight or UV light source under a drawing on a translucent support. Where the light strikes the sensitized support, the ferric salts become ferrous salts. After exposure, the support is immersed in a water bath. A chemical reaction between the water and ferrous salts produces the Prussian blue pigment (ferric ferrocyanide). The ferric salts, which remain in the unexposed areas, are washed away. This results in the white lines which create the image. The main difference in the process of the creating a pellet print was the addition of a colloid (e.g. dextrin, gum arabic, or gelatin) on the surface of the sensitized support (paper or cloth).</dd>
  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>Blueprints were commonly produced between the 1870s and 1930s. The process was invented by Sir John Herschel in 1842, but was not widely adopted until the 1870s. Pre-sensitized papers became available in 1876 from the Marion Company of Paris. This paper was sold worldwide, including in the United States. Blueprints/cyanotypes were frequently produced in-house. Beginning in the 1920s, machines were available which could produce complete prints from start to finish. Blueprints decreased in popularity with the development of the diazo process which used vapor to develop the image rather than immersion in a liquid bath. This was particularly important for technical prints in which dimensional changes could occur with the introduction of moisture, making a "dry" process preferable in order to preserve the original scale of the drawing. Nonetheless, the blueprint/cyanotype process was widely used before the 1930s and represents one of the most widely held types of technical prints in collections.</dd>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>VanDyke prints may be found as either a positive or negative image on a paper support. In either case, the brown of the image will exhibit a slightly cool, metallic quality when viewed under light. The brown image material will appear to be embedded into the fibers of the paper support. Negative VanDyke prints (white lines on a brown ground) were typically created as an internegative, used in service of creating a final blueprint or a positive VanDyke. Positive VanDyke prints (brown lines on a white ground) often resemble sepia diazo prints, but the uniformity of the positive VanDyke’s "white" paper ground sets it apart from the speckled, "dirty" ground of a sepia diazo. The brown lines of a VanDyke print are also generally cooler in tone than those of a sepia diazo. VanDyke prints are generally high contrast. Blue staining on the verso (back) is the result of residual iron salts.</dd>

<dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>Residual chemicals from image processing may cause the image to yellow and support to weaken. VanDyke prints are prone to silvering and may yellow significantly, especially if they were not properly washed during processing. Deterioration characteristics and handling recommendations are on the whole similar to those for silver gelatin prints, photostats, and other silver-based photographic processes.</dd>
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd>Moderate. Exposure to air pollutants is a significant threat to silver images, and warm, humid environments will accelerate these destructive effects. Due to the residual chemicals in VanDyke prints, and their sensitivity to airborne pollutants, it is recommended that they be stored in polyester sleeves.</dd>
  <dt>Process</dt>
  <dd>A negative VanDyke was typically created as an internegative, used in service of creating a final blueprint or positive VanDyke print. The production process for creating VanDyke prints is similar to that used for the production of blueprints, with the addition of a fixing bath. The support paper is first coated with a sensitizing solution comprised of silver salts, iron salts, and an organic acid. After this coating is dried, the paper is placed in direct contact with an original drawing or intermediate negative and exposed to light. The ferric salts are chemically altered when exposed to light. The exposed print is rinsed in water, releasing the organic acid in the coating. This acidity creates a reaction between the iron and silver, producing a brown color in the exposed areas. The unexposed ferric salts remain water soluble and are washed away, leaving the support paper visible. The print is placed in a fixing bath, rinsed a final time, and then dried.</dd>
  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>The process used to create VanDyke prints was originally patented in 1889 by H. Shawcross in Paris. The process was patented by him again in 1892, this time in England. A similar process was registered in 1901 by a man with the surname Vandyke, which is where the process name originated. VanDyke prints were produced beginning in the 1890s through the early 1960s. As with other wet processes, the VanDyke process was phased out by the increasing use of diazo prints, which were preferred for their dry processing (eliminating any concern for dimensional variations caused by the introduction of moisture). VanDyke prints were typically used as internegatives, with the final product being either a positive blueprint or positive VanDyke print. The process was useful for reproducing damaged originals, and very faint images such as pencil drawings.</dd>

  <dd>
  <p>Technical prints were generally not made with long-term stability in mind; most were created quickly and cheaply to serve an ephemeral, utilitarian purpose. As a result, many of these prints may retain chemical residues from processing. These residual chemicals may off-gas or cause damage if placed in contact with other prints. Always segregate VanDykes from diazo prints; the latter of which contains the silver-bleaching chemical thiourea.</p>
  <p>Technical prints are usually large and may be stored horizontally in flat files or rolled. Enameled steel, stainless steel, or anodized aluminum flat files are preferred. Store different types of architectural prints separately in order to prevent contact degradation. Folders cut to drawer size are recommended, with less than 12 prints to a folder, interleaving sheets placed between them (both alkaline or neutral pH). Individual prints should be stored in polyester sleeves within folders in order to protect particularly fragile items and to separate formats from one another. Polyester sleeves also provide additional support during handling.</p>
  <p>If space for flat storage is not available, it may be acceptable to store the prints rolled. Brittle or otherwise fragile prints should not be rolled. Prints that are strong and flexible enough to be rolled must have an interior support: a neutral pH cardboard tube (over 3" diameter) itself wrapped in polyester or neutral paper. The rolled print (and interior support) may be wrapped in the neutral paper or polyester and stored horizontally, not upright. Prints should not be folded; this will create fold lines which weaken the paper and cause it to tear. All storage materials should pass the Photographic Activity Test (PAT) as specified in ISO Standard 18916:2007.</p>

  <dd>The image may be negative or positive, although negatives (white image/text on black background) are more common. The image/text is comprised of silver particles, as in silver gelatin DOP prints. Copies are similar to silver gelatin black and white photographs, including the tendency to exhibit silver mirroring. The image may be high-contrast black and white, or black and white with shades of gray if produced from a color or pencil-drawn original. The paper is thinner than most photographic paper as it lacks a baryta layer and has thinner emulsion. Until the 1920s, the largest possible print size was 8 ½" × 11"; in the 1920s prints could be made up to 18" × 24". Final prints as large as 40" × 60" could be produced by commercial photo labs specializing in architectural and engineering drawings.</dd>

  <dd>Preservation of photostatic prints is nearly identical to the preservation properties of silver gelatin DOP prints (see profiles for <a href="../photosimages/photoprint.html">Photographic Prints</a>). Photostatic prints are prone to silvering and may yellow significantly, especially if they were not properly washed.</dd>
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd>Moderately low. Exposure to air pollutants is often the significant prolonged threat to silver image materials, but warm and humid environments will only accelerate the destructive effects.</dd>
  <dt>Process</dt>
  <dd>Photostat copy machines were basically large cameras which used a prism to produce a right-reading image. Each exposure produced one print, usually a negative (black background with white text). In 1953 Kodak released a direct-positive process, allowing for the production of positive copies from a positive original. A positive image could also be produced by creating a negative copy and copying the negative again to create a positive image. After exposure, the paper was placed in a developing bath beneath the camera, then a fixer bath. Processing was completed in darkroom conditions. The print was then washed in water, with excess water removed using a squeegee after taking the print out of the final bath. The print was finally dried by pressing between blotters, passing through a set of heated rollers, or dried face-down on glass (this would result in a glossy finish).</dd>
  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>The Rectigraph, manufactured in Rochester, NY beginning in 1909, was the first commercially produced photostatic copy machine. After 1920, when larger print sizes became available, photostat prints of architectural drawings became more common. By 1936, photostat papers were available in a range of grades and finishes. Sensitized fabric, Sensitex, could also be used in place of paper. In 1953 Eastman Kodak Company introduced a direct-positive process.</dd>

  <dd>Wash-off prints are always positive images. The image may be printed in reverse. The image lines/text are black and ink-like, strong, appearing to sit on the surface of the support in slight relief. Because of this, wash-off prints are often mistaken for original ink drawings. A metallic sheen may also be observed in the image material. The image is of a high contrast and the ground is generally clean and smooth, but sometimes tiny black flecks left over from the emulsion may be littered across the whitespace. The early supports were frequently medium-weight glossy tracing cloth. By the 1950s, prints were also made on vellum tracing paper and polyester (Mylar). If on cloth, the ground may be slightly discolored or stained. Images were often printed in reverse to be used as reproducibles.</dd>

</dd>
<dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>Preservation factors of a wash-off print are similar to those of a silver gelatin print (see profiles for <a href="../photosimages/photoprint.html">Photographic Prints</a>). Wash-off prints may become oxidized causing the black image to turn warm brown or yellow. The black lines may also exhibit silver mirroring. Drafting cloth support (and ground) may discolor or stain over time. Prints made on plastic support may become brittle or yellowed depending on the type of plastic. Most documentation suggests polyester supports were used to make wash-off prints, which will not exhibit these deteriorative characteristics.</dd>
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd>Moderate. Exposure to air pollutants is a significant threat to silver images, and warm, humid environments will accelerate these destructive effects. Though the full array of plastic support materials used is not definitively known, polyester film was the primary plastic base and will therefore be relatively stable. Regardless of the support material, high temperatures and high humid environments should be avoided.</dd>
  <dt>Process</dt>
  <dd>Wash-off prints were produced using a Vandyke negative as the intermediate image. The Vandyke negative itself was produced via contact printing from the original tracing. The final support material was sensitized with a silver halide sensitizing agent and an alkaline activated developer in a gelatin emulsion (Price, 2010, p. 189). The sensitized support was then exposed under the Vandyke negative, causing the exposed areas to become insoluble. The non-image areas were then washed away in water, and the print was immersed in a highly alkaline activating solution that developed and hardened the image. A final bath removed the developer. At this point, the image could be altered by wiping the surface with cotton or a camel hair brush. Some manufacturers recommended that the final wash be followed by an additional fixer bath to further harden the image. The image was then hung to dry.</dd>
  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>The wash-off process was developed in the early 1920s and is one of the earliest silver-based processes used for drawing duplication. Two companies claimed credit for creating the process: Charles Bruning Co. and Frederick Post Co., both of Chicago. It was advertized as an innovative process capable of reproducing the look of hand-drawn tracings without the time and cost. Wash-off prints were relatively expensive to produce compared to other architectural print processes, and were used to create duplicate copies of original tracings. Since the prints could be altered during processing, it was also used to produce clean copies of damaged, soiled, or discolored tracings, or to make revisions to an original. Prior to the 1950s, when vellum paper (plasticized cotton) and polyester film emerged, wash-off prints existed primarily on glossy drafting cloth supports. Direct positive wash-off film had some success through the 1970s (Kissel &amp; Vigneau, 1999). The wash-off process is still in limited use today, referred to as wash-off Mylar by most. The prints are also known as silver slicks and are made on a matte polyester support rather than tracing cloth (Price, 2010, p. 189).</dd>

  <dd>The diazo print (or diazo for short) is the result of a duplication process yielding a direct positive image. A diazo is an azo dye line drawing reproduction of an original line drawing (frequently deep blue or purple, also black or brown) on a near-white background. Fibers will be visible under low magnification. Diazos have a smooth, lightly calendered surface. The verso (back) is usually white, but may show signs of discoloration in the form of yellow stripes. May possess an ammonia odor, which can be transmitted to other documents stored together. Sepia diazo prints (brown lines on a flecked ground), frequently used as intermediate images, are often printed in reverse and may have a waxy or oily coating. "Ozalid" brand paper, a common, patented diazotype paper, will have brown-red lines and a faint rust-colored ground (the presence of a trade name watermark will also help). </dd>

</dd>
<dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>Due to residual chemicals, paper will likely be brittle. Edges may also be discolored. Yellow and brown discoloration is more likely to occur on the image-side of the print and along the edges. The azo dye-based image/text may be faded, particularly if housed in an acidic enclosure or exposed to light for an extended period. Residual chemicals and light exposure can together cause yellowish-brown discoloration in unexposed areas. Diazos must be stored separately from most photographic materials due to their destructive off-gassing. Sepia diazo prints, frequently used as intermediate images, may be coated with wax, paraffin, or oil to increase translucency. This coating may transfer to other objects and results in a characteristic reddish pink discoloration or greasy smudging.</dd>
  

  
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd>Moderately high (older prints are at higher risk). All diazo prints should be assumed fragile and volatile. Diazos were often poorly processed and, as a result, will contain residual chemicals harmful to themselves and other materials stored in proximity. They are also known to transfer color dyes to adjacent papers. Diazos should therefore be stored separately from other materials if possible. Original drawings or reformatted copies, if any, should be retained. Alkaline storage enclosures are not advised for diazo prints.</dd>
  <dt>Process</dt>
  <dd>The diazo process is similar to blueprinting and other early reprographic processes, with some chemical differences. The support is coated with a sensitizing solution containing a diazo compound and a coupler compound, in addition to other additives (i.e. optical brighteners). Depending on the coupler, the image color will vary (blue, purple, brown, etc.). Copies were produced from a translucent master drawing placed over the sensitized paper. They are then exposed to a strong UV light source: the master is used like a photographic negative, in which light is blocked in dark (lines/text) areas and allowed to pass through light (background) areas. The underlying support is then exposed to an ammonia (alkaline) gas. This gas works to catalyze a chemical reaction to produce a print image that fixes in the paper or cloth.</dd>
  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>The diazo print was the most popular of the dry printing processes and is the most common large scale reprographic format found in late 20th century collections. Diazo prints were made as early as the 1880s but the process was not widely used until 1923 when the process was commercialized and Ozalid paper was marketed by Kalle &amp; Co. of Germany. The diazo process was primarily used for copying technical drawings beginning in the 1920s, but was also used for office copying from the 1930s to 1970s. The diazo process gained popularity quickly due to its simple dry processing and ability to reproduce both pencil and ink lines. Diazos replaced blueprints in most architectural and engineering offices by the 1950s, and continue to be produced to the present day.</dd>

  <dd>
  <p>Technical prints were generally not made with long-term stability in mind; most were created quickly and cheaply to serve an ephemeral, utilitarian purpose. Many of these prints will retain chemical residues from processing. These residual chemicals may off-gas or cause damage if placed in contact with other prints. Always segregate diazo prints from silver-image prints (i.e. Photostats, VanDykes, Wash-Offs), as the former contains thioura, a silver-bleaching chemical.</p>
  <p>Prints are usually large and should be stored horizontally in flat files or rolled if flat storage is not possible. Enameled steel, stainless steel, or anodized aluminum flat files are preferred. Store different types of technical prints separately in order to prevent contact degradation. Alkaline storage materials are not advised for diazos. Folders cut to drawer size are recommended, with less than 12 prints to a folder, interleaving sheets placed between them (both alkaline-free). Individual prints may be stored in polyester sleeves within folders in order to protect particularly fragile items or to separate formats from one another. Polyester sleeves also provide additional support during handling.</p>
  <p>If space for flat storage is not available, it may be acceptable to store the prints rolled. Brittle or otherwise fragile prints should not be rolled. Prints that are strong and flexible enough to be rolled must have an interior support: a neutral pH cardboard tube (over 3" diameter) itself wrapped in polyester or neutral paper. The rolled print (and interior support) may be wrapped in the neutral paper or polyester and stored horizontally, not upright. Prints should not be folded; this will create fold lines which weaken the paper and cause it to tear. All storage materials should pass the Photographic Activity Test (PAT) as specified in ISO Standard 18916:2007.</p>

  <p>Responsible display practices ensure the long-term preservation of collections. Whenever possible, facsimiles should be used. Paper artifacts should not be displayed permanently.

<p>Although not quite as light-sensitive as cyanotypes (Koerner &amp; Potje, 2002), diazos are still very sensitive to light. It is advisable to consider the use of facsimiles in place of original documents for exhibition. If original prints are displayed, it should for no longer than 3 months at 3 ft-c maximum with a 3-year rest period between display cycles.</p>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Hectograph image/text is commonly purple or blue color but can be multiple colored aniline dyes, including brown (c. 1900). Initially, the paper is bright white with a heavily finished, glossy surface (to control ink use). If on an acidic paper support, the ground will likely have yellowed. Hectography was most often used for handwritten and typewritten documents, though sometimes technical drawings. They are very similar in appearance to diazo prints and spirit duplicates. Image lines will appear fuzzy, and image details low definition. Aniline dyes have a tendency to fade, particularly when exposed to UV light; the resulting image may be of low contrast.</dd>

<dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>An image/text composed of aniline dye ink is very sensitive to UV light, and water/moisture. Image fading and resulting loss of contrast is common. Some aniline ink migration and bleeding may result from water exposure. Though high-quality paper will retain white ground color (with slight discoloration), the more common wood pulp paper supports will be brittle and noticeably yellowed. </dd>
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd>Moderate. UV light exposure is the primary risk to hectographic (aniline dye) prints. High temperature and high humidity will accelerate deterioration of both image and support materials. Quality of the paper support will weigh heavily in permanence. Residual acidic chemicals on the paper could accelerate breakdown. Alum/rosin sizing, impregnated in mechanical wood pulp papers, will lead to embrittlement and yellowing of the paper support.</dd>
  <dt>Common Size(s)</dt>
  <dd>Varied; typically large: dimensions may be over 4 feet.</dd>
  <dt>Process</dt>
  <dd>First, a gelatin-and glycerin pad is created to serve as a transfer plate. It is softened and dissolved, poured into a tray/frame, where it sets and firms up but retains moisture. Next, a master document or drawing is rendered in hectographic (aniline) ink. Once the ink dries, the master is pressed face down onto the gelatin-and-glycerin pad surface and left to allow the water-soluble ink transfer as a negative image. An alternate method for applying ink to the pad involved the use of a stencil. In either case, the pad was then pressed in contact with copy paper, which absorbed the aniline ink, resulting in a final positive copy. This could typically produce 40 to 60 copies, each successively lower contrast than the preceding copy.</dd>
  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>The hectographic process emerged as a result of the introduction of aniline inks, becoming common as an technical/architectural reprographic process around 1870 (Kissel &amp; Vigneau). Hectographs at that time were regarded as the most practical method of large-scale drawing duplication, and rose in public favor quickly. Along with its contemporary, the aniline printing process, hectographs remained popular as a technical and engineering drawing duplication technique until the end of the 19th century, when blueprints became the standard.</dd>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Gel-lithographs are often identified by their dense black image lines, though nearly any color is possible. Because of this, gel-lithos are often mistaken for original ink drawings. If black carbon ink, these lines will exhibit little to no fading and will appear sharp. The ground color is light, often off-white, but may be discolored. As this is a lithographic process, the ink will appear to sit on top of the support (paper, drafting paper) surface; this is particularly noticeable under magnification. Most prints on drafting cloth will lose whatever glossy surface finish they once had on the image-side due to exposure to the gelatin pad; surface finish loss is not necessarily true for the edges of the cloth, which will remain glossy, having avoided contact with the transfer pad. Gel-lithos are occasionally printed in reverse. Any reverse-reading text will be a clear indication. Gel litho images could also be printed on the verso (back) of a semi-translucent drafting cloth to illustrate proposed changes.</dd>

<dt>Deterioration</dt>
  <dd>Gel-lithograph images rendered in black ink are very stable. Under reasonable conditions, a (pigment-based) black image will remain very stable. Color inks will be more vulnerable to light fading. The integrity of the support material (paper or cloth) is the decisive factor for gel-lithographs. For instance, if printed on a wood pulp paper with alum-rosin sizing, the support will be yellowed, brittle, and acidic.</dd>
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd>Low (especially if printed in carbon black ink). Colored inks will be more vulnerable to light exposure. The quality of the support will be a decisive factor in the preservation of a gel-lithograph; avoid high temperatures and extremes of humidity.</dd>
  <dt>Common Size(s)</dt>
  <dd>Varied; often over 40" × 60"</dd>
  <dt>Process</dt>
  <dd>First, a gelatin pad is created to serve as a transfer plate. It is softened and dissolved, poured into a tray (sometimes quite large), where it sets and firms up but retains moisture. After this, the process diverges into two possible methods. The first is photo-reproductive process: a sensitized (but undeveloped) blueprint is placed under a master document/drawing on a translucent support and exposed to a UV light source: the master is used like a photographic negative, in which light is blocked in dark (lines/text) areas and allowed to pass through light (background) areas. The blueprint now shows a faint latent image that can be edited with special solvents. The second method is more akin to hectography: a document or drawing is rendered in an "actinic" ink that dissolves when in contact with gelatin. Finally, the two methods reconverge. The blueprint or actinic ink drawing is pressed face-down onto the gelatin pad and left to allow the intermediate blueprint or actinic ink to be absorbed. When pulled away, a final positive copy remains to be inked for image transfer. This could produce as many as 100 copies, each of successively lower contrast than the preceding copy.</dd>
  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>Pioneered in 1900, it was not until around 1910 that gel-lithographs reached the public and quickly gained widespread use, which it maintained more or less until the 1950s, when diazotypes rose in favor. Though they were time-consuming, expensive, and required some skill, gel-litho printing could produce stable, precise, true-to-scale images in colored ink on nearly any support--without the use of aqueous treatments. Professionals benefitted from the ability to print onto a drawing paper and continue working with additional media with no risk posed to the original drawing. Patent offices often required inked originals, and these would easily pass as such. When printed onto a tracing paper or cloth, a gel-litho could function as a reproduction template to be utilized through other contact-printed reprographic processes, such as blueprints.</dd>

  <dd>
  <p>Electrostatic copies tend to be very stable and image permanent as the toner is black carbon pigment in a resin carrier—both inert materials. Proper processing will ensure permanence, but is dependent upon the quality of the paper.</p>

<p>"Electrostatic copies should be stored at moderate temperature and relative humidity. Because the resin binders are thermoplastic polymers with low softening temperatures, avoid storage under conditions of heat and/or pressure. Experience has shown that the binder resins in xerographic copies are vulnerable to blocking to adjacent surfaces with heat or pressure. Contact with polyvinyl chloride plastic can cause softening and transfer to adjacent surfaces because of plasticizer migration from the plastic ... A black xerox copy can be expected to have good to excellent light stability, depending on the quality of the paper support" (Nicholson, 1989).</p>
  </dd>
  
  <dt>Risk Level</dt>
  <dd>Low. Store in a moderate environment. Avoid exposure to heat and pressure, in addition to polyester storage materials, as any one of them could cause toner loss and transfer to adjacent materials (Nicholson, 1989).</dd>
  
  <dt>Process</dt>
  <dd>Electrostatic copies are made through a five step process. First a photoconductive selenium plate or drum is charged. The plate or drum is then exposed to a pattern of light from the original document, leaving only the image areas charged. A powdered toner is then applied over the plate or drum which only adheres to the electrostatically charged areas. The sheet of copy paper, which is given an electrical charge of opposite polarity to the plate or drum, is then brought in contact with the plate or drum thus transferring the image. The toner is fused to the paper with heat.</dd>
  
  <dt>Background</dt>
  <dd>The first commercial xerographic machines were produced by the Haloid Company (now Xerox Corporation) in 1949. The first machines were manual, with the first semi-automatic machine, the Copyflo, being released in 1955. In 1959 Xerox released the first all-in-one copier, the Xerox 914, and at that point electrostatic copying began to dominate the office copying market. Additional single color toners were produced in the late 1950s, but it was not until the Xerox 6500 color copier’s introduction in 1973 that full-color xerography arrived (see <a href="officeprintcopy.htm#colorxerox">Color Photocopy</a>). Since the 1960s, electrostatic copiers have remained the most popular office copying machine due to their simplicity and speed.</dd>

<p>"Oversize" is a designation for items that do not easily fit into the common folder, archival box, or container without being rolled, folded (which is typically discouraged), or placed flat in a flat file cabinet (ideal, but not feasible for large collections). For more on the storage of oversized formats, see the NEDCC’s leaflet <a href="http://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/4.-storage-and-handling/4.9-storage-solutions-for-oversized-paper-artifacts" target="_blank">Storage Solutions For Oversized Paper Artifacts</a>.
