  <h1>Paper</h1>

  <p><em>Paper is typically a support that carries ink or other media. Click through for information on indetifying and preserving <a href="http://psap.library.illinois.edu/format-id-guide/inkothermedia">ink and other media</a>.</em></p>

  <p>Paper is composed of cellulose fibers derived from plants. Paper quality depends largely on its fiber source and production method. The practice of beating cotton or linen cloth rags into pulp and then using screens to form sheets began in 14th century Europe. The term for this product is rag paper, and it is often found in good condition due to the neutral pH content of cotton and linen fibers. Flax and hemp fibers are also commonly incorporated. Wood pulp was not used until the mid-19th century, and early wood pulp papers required the use of harsh chemicals to process wood into usable pulp. Additionally, many types of wood contain lignin, a protein which generates acid as it deteriorates, causing yellowing and embrittling as lignin reacts to light and heat exposure. As a result, wood pulp papers—especially those produced from about 1850 to 1950—are typically in poor condition. In addition to raw materials, processing chemicals (additives, solvents) will produce certain qualities which affect the appearance and stability of the final product.</p>

  <h2>Primary Factors</h2>

  <dl>
    <dt>Fibers</dt>

    <dd>Wood pulp naturally contains lignin, an acidic substance that causes paper to discolor, embrittle, and deteriorate rapidly when exposed to heat and light. During the milling process, lignin can be removed from pulp using chemical solvents. Low-quality paper (newsprint, groundwood) is often produced without lignin removal and is therefore acidic and prone to rapid deterioration.</dd>

    <dt>Coatings</dt>

    <dd>Coatings are applied to create a smooth, bright surface, and often provide a glossy finish. Coated papers provide an optimal surface for mechanical printing processes. The substances used in paper coatings vary widely and include minerals, synthetic materials, and plastics (e.g. resin-coated papers). Clay is a common coating and filler substance; it is also very sensitive to water and high humidity. Some coatings age poorly and become yellow and brittle. See Coated Paper profile for more info.</dd>

    <dt>Sizing</dt>

    <dd>Sizing is meant to strengthen paper and to prevent inks from bleeding into the fibers, ultimately yielding crisper print quality. It can be internal (e.g. alum-rosin) or applied as a coating (e.g. gelatin). Use of alum-rosin began in the 1830s, initially strengthening paper. Over time, however, the acidic nature of alum-rosin led to darkening and embrittlement of paper. Overuse of alum-rosin, in combination with acidic wood pulp, means much of the paper from the later 19th century and early 20th century exhibits these symptoms. The Library of Congress suggests that any wood pulp paper from before the 1980s can be suspected of alum-rosin acidity.</dd>

    <dt>Other Additives (e.g. fillers, optical brighteners, tinting agents)</dt>

    <dd>Filler substances can be added to create a smooth, shiny paper surface. Overfilled paper may be particularly susceptible to tears and damage from folding. Beginning in the 1950s, calcium carbonate was added as a filler to create an alkaline buffer in many papers. Coloring agents and optical brightening agents added to papers (internally or as a coating) may not be lightfast, and may cause fading, yellowing, or embrittlement.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h2>General Preservation</h2>

  <dl>
    <dt>Deterioration</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Paper is sensitive to light and water exposure, high humidity, and high heat. Exposure to light and/or heat will accelerate deterioration in the form of yellowing and sometimes embrittlement. Acidic paper (pH below 7.0) commonly exhibits both deteriorative traits. Colored media on the paper support will fade rapidly. Water exposure can ultimately lead to desiccated or brittle paper, therefore more easily torn or damaged through handling. Fluctuating temperature and RH may result in warping, cockling of the paper surface. High humidity (higher than 68% RH) promotes mold growth and insect infestation, both of which can cause permanent damage.</p>

        </figure>
      </div>

      <p>Even pH neutral papers will become increasingly acidic over time. This is due to the fact that cellulose naturally generates acids as it ages. Papers, including book leaves, that are darker and more brittle along their edges than center demonstrate an absorption of airborne pollutants that have formed acids.</p>

      <p>Soil and dust may become ground into paper fibers, permanently soiling or staining the paper surface. Foxing is a common form of paper deterioration which manifests as reddish-brown spots or blotches which appear embedded in the paper surface. Foxing is caused by a number of factors, but is commonly spurred along by high humidity.</p>

    <dt>Risk Level</dt>

    <dd>Light damage to paper materials is irreversible and cumulative. Pay close attention, monitor tone, and never exhibit originals longer than 6 months cumulatively. Any paper pH measuring below 6.5 should be considered dangerously acidic. Media type will factor into the complete assessment: e.g. color ink typically heightens risk, black ink typically is a non-issue. See Ink &amp; Other Media for more info.</dd>

    <dt>Storage</dt>

    <dd>Document-sized paper should be stored in archival folders, boxes, or files. Oversize items are best stored flat in a flat file drawer, with items kept separate or with like materials of similar dimensions (interleaved with acid-free sheets) in specially tailored folders, cut from acid-free, buffered paper. If flat storage is not possible, flexible, sturdy paper items may be stored rolled around a tube. Paper items should not be folded, as folding creates areas of weakness in the paper making it prone to tearing.</dd>

    <dt>About Oversized Materials</dt>

    <dd>"Oversized" can be thought of as a designation for items that do not easily fit into the common folder, archival box or container without being rolled or folded. For more on the storage of oversized formats, see the NEDCC’s Storage Solutions For Oversized Paper Artifacts. To minimize risk when handling oversize materials, place a thick support (e.g. heavyweight folder, corrugated paper board) under the item as a rigid support when it is being moved about—preferably with the assistance of another.</dd>

    <dt>Description</dt>

    <dd>Newsprint is a soft, off-white paper, though sometimes it may be lightly tinted (pink, yellow, blue). It is primarily composed of groundwood pulp, and, as a result, is frequently found in poor condition due to its short fibers and inherent acidity. Newsprint is commonly used for newspapers and other non-archival ephemera (e.g. flyers, newsletters). Newspapers have historically been printed by relief (letterpress, flexographic) or offset (lithographic) processes. Text is typically printed in black ink, made of carbon black pigment. Four-color printing (CMYK) is also common today, producing "full-color" images generally of limited contrast and sharpness.</dd>

    <dt>Deterioration</dt>

    <dd>Newsprint deteriorates rapidly, especially when exposed to UV light and heat. As the paper deteriorates, it rapidly yellows and becomes brittle. Severely deteriorated newsprint will flake and "shatter" when handled. Items on newsprint are often large-format and stored folded, and they may have tears from poor handling. The paper will fracture more easily along folds.</dd>

    <dt>Risk Level</dt>

    <dd>High. Due to the highly acidic nature of most newsprint, reformatting is the recommended option for long-term preservation.</dd>

    <dt>Background</dt>

    <dd>Newsprint came into wide use in the mid-1860s, when American paper manufacturers adopted wood fiber processing. Prior to this, newspapers were printed on a variety of papers made using straw, hemp, or cotton fibers. Mechanical production of wood-based paper helped manufacturers to meet increasing demands for daily newspapers. This fast and cheap pulping process did not involve the removal of lignin, the substance which causes newsprint to yellow and brittle through oxidation. It can be assumed that any newspaper after the mid-19th century will be on this volatile newsprint. Today’s newsprint is increasingly produced with recycled fibers, but should also be assumed unstable.</dd>

    <dt>Storage</dt>

    <dd>
      Due to residual acids in wood pulp paper, newsprint will inevitably deteriorate and become unusable. A proper storage environment will slow deterioration but will not stop it completely. See the Library of Congress guidelines on the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/preservation/care/newspap.html">Preservation Measures for Newspapers</a>.
    </dd>

    <dt>About Reformatting</dt>

    <dd>
      For small clippings that are retained for informational purposes, the easiest course of action is to make a preservation photocopy on permanent paper. Large newspaper collections have historically been microfilmed, beginning in the 1950s. Microfilming remains an option for preserving newspapers to the present day. Many institutions with the available infrastructure now choose to digitize their newspaper holdings as an alternative preservation strategy. The <a href="http://www.loc.gov/ndnp/">Library of Congress National Digital Newspaper</a> program provides information and guidelines about newspaper digitization. USNP (United States Newspaper Program) provides <a href="http://www.loc.gov/rr/news/usnp/usnpguidelinesp.html">Preservation Microfilming Guidelines</a>.

      </ul>
    </dd>

    <dt>Description</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Taken at face value, "acid-free" is the paper industry’s designation for any paper produced with a neutral pH (7) or alkaline pH (&gt;7), containing no acidic pulp, lignin, or sulphur. Note that the acid-free status is determined at the time of manufacture and is no guarantee of stability over time. It may be composed of cotton rag or wood pulp (in that case alkaline-buffered). Acid-free paper that meets either ANSI or ISO standards may be labelled as such, with the acid-free symbol (∞ set within a circle) or printed with some statement of compliance (e.g. "meets the minimum requirements of the American National Standard for Information Sciences—Permanence of Paper for Printed Library Materials, ANSI/NISO Z39.48-1992"). There are several additional distinctions and standard-specific terms among acid-free papers:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>"Permanent paper" is a term for paper adhering to ANSI/NISO Z39.48 (1992, updated in 2009), which is the U.S. standard for coated and uncoated papers that will last several hundred years under normal use. It includes standards for pH, tear resistance, alkaline reserve, and paper stock (lignin levels). A similar international standard for permanent paper, ISO 9706, was published in 1994. Although permanent paper can often be referred to as "acid-free paper," not all acid-free paper necessarily meets standards for permanent paper.</li>

        <li>"Archival paper" is statement of quality that—when invoked appropriately—indicates the paper meets either the U.S. (ANSI/NISO Z39.48) or another international standard (ISO 1108). The term "archival," much like "acid-free," is often used in a loose and misleading manner by paper manufacturers. True archival paper is acid-free and generally more durable than permanent paper. True "archival-grade" (or "museum-grade") paper is composed of cotton rag pulp. "Conservation-grade" paper, on the other hand, is wood pulp-based, and buffered.</li>
      </ul>
    </dd>

    <dt>Deterioration</dt>

    <dd>As acid-free paper is specifically manufactured without inherent vice, it therefore avoids most symptoms of acidic content (i.e. darkening, yellowing, brittleness). However, "acid-free" does not necessarily mean that the material will maintain a stable pH. Light damage, paper staining and mechanical damage can affect any paper.</dd>

    <dt>Risk Level</dt>

    <dd>Low. Permanent paper is designed to last several hundred years under normal use and is the preservation standard for paper documents. Permanent paper should be used in the production of important documents and for preservation photocopies.</dd>

  </div>

  <dl>
    <dt>Description</dt>

    <dd>Coated paper may be either plant fiber based or wood fiber based. The coatings used on papers vary by their intended use. Early papers were often coated with gelatin (surface sizing), but the use of true paper coatings as opposed to sizing did not begin until the 1850s in the US. Clay and calcium carbonate are common paper coating substances, used in advertising, magazines, and books with color illustration/photography. Coating the paper serves a number of purposes. Paper coatings help to cultivate a uniform surface, better suited for print, and enhance the opacity, smoothness, and gloss of the paper surface. Coatings also have been used as a cost-saving measure, to brighten and mitigate the rough features of low-grade and recycled pulps. The actual materials used in paper coatings vary widely, and while some coatings impart extra strength and longevity to papers, others pose a significant preservation risk.</dd>

    <dt>Deterioration</dt>

    <dd>Some coatings may contain acidic materials that cause yellowing and embrittlement. Coated papers are generally more sensitive to abrasion than uncoated papers, and are very sensitive to water. If sheets of coated paper are exposed to water, they may "block" together if not separated quickly. This blocking cannot be reversed. A disaster recovery procedure in the event of water exposure should be established for coated papers of all kinds, especially clay-coated book papers.</dd>

    <dt>Risk Level</dt>

    <dd>Low to high (no "set" risk; varies widely by coating). If low quality, machine pulped or waste pulp was used to create the paper, this will greatly impact the preservation risk regardless of the coating. Early resin coated papers are a moderate-high risk.</dd>

    <dt>Background</dt>

    <dd>Paper coatings were pioneered in the US between 1852 and 1872. Beginning with natural coatings such as wax and gelatin, today’s paper coatings are likely to be some amalgam of natural and synthetic substances, resin being especially common.</dd>

    <dd>
      <p>Identification of transparent paper subtypes can be difficult, as many will share the same traits (e.g. ivory color, thin, overbeaten fibers). Some of these papers can be fairly thick and used in ways which have nothing to do with tracing (e.g. certificates, ledgers). "Tracing/transparent paper," as defined here, include: natural tracing paper, prepared tracing paper (i.e. vellum paper), vegetable parchment paper, imitation parchment paper, and onionskin paper.</p>

      <p>Natural tracing paper is the most prevalent of modern transparent papers, and are produced in a fashion similar to imitation parchment, in that chemical wood fibers are overbeaten to the point of even transparency across the sheet. The surface may be calendered and/or coated. On the whole, natural tracing paper will be among the most translucent and have a matte surface.</p>

      <p>Prepared tracing papers of the past were made translucent through the addition of oil, starch, or varnish. These will often exhibit fluorescence. Today’s methods involve impregnating the paper with a resin or composite. Vellum paper (1850s–present) is one such paper, made with plasticized cotton fibers or sometimes wood pulp. This synthetic vellum has a smooth and even surface, typically only semi-transparent through light, and is often used for drawings and reprographic copies (of drawings). Because the paper is dimensionally stable (will not fluctuate with environmental changes, which would distort the image scale), it is well-suited for architectural plans and technical drawings.</p>

      <p>Parchment paper is a generic term for two classes of transparent papers of similar appearance:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Vegetable parchment paper (1850s–1950s) may be either rag-stock or chemical wood pulp, rendered semi-transparent through an acid treatment (followed by alkaline neutralization), and then calendered. Vegetable parchment is comparatively thick, firm, and may have a blotchy fiber lay pattern.</li>

        <li>Imitation parchment paper (early 1900s–present) is composed of overbeaten chemical wood pulp that is then calendered to achieve a very smooth surface. Rag-based parchment is possible for legal documents and certificates, but rare. The surface of either is often very glossy, such as in the case of glassine, and may resist media. Wood pulp-based imitation is often used for food wrapping (meat, cheese, etc.).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>"Onionskin" paper is a lightweight, durable tissue that is characterized by its white or canary color, tactile crispness, and translucent onionskin appearance. Historically, onionskin is produced from cotton rag-stock, but may contain wood pulp. The surface texture may be glazed or unglazed with a cockled quality. Onionskin has been used primarily in office typing duplication (see <a href="officeprintcopy.htm#carboncopy">Carbon Paper</a>).</p>

    <dt>Deterioration</dt>

    <dd>Thin papers made up of short, overbeaten fibers (natural tracing paper, imitation parchment) or those treated with acid (vegetable parchment) tend to be more fragile. Early forms of prepared tracing papers may emit noticeable odors or transfer oils onto adjacent materials. Interleave these with unbuffered, acid-free sheets in order to prevent oils or resins from spreading. Quality onionskin and other rag-stock fiber papers are very durable and stable. On the whole, however, tracing papers (especially if brittle and/or discolored) must be handled with care.</dd>

    <dt>Risk Level</dt>

    <dd>Any of the tracing papers described above can contain wood pulp (medium-high risk), but could be rag-stock (and therefore low risk). Onionskin and semi-translucent legal document papers are generally lower risk as use of cotton rag is common. Basically, it's best to evaluate based on signs of acidic paper decomposition (brittleness, discoloration) to determine the preservation risk item-by-item. Considering the typically fragile and oversized nature of many tracing paper documents, care must be taken when handling.</dd>

    <dt>Background</dt>

    <dd>Beginning in the mid-19th century, tracing paper (or transparent paper) was widely and primarily used by engineers, architects, and designers to create copies of plans/drawings where accuracy was necessary. In the early 20th century, tracing paper was used as an intermediary in creation of photochemical copying process (e.g. diazotypes). Artists also use tracing paper, but it is mostly among architectural collections that tracing papers will be found. Tracing paper continues to be used today.</dd>
