<h1>Papyrus</h1>
<p>Although papyrus falls outside the scope of the PSAP, here are a few key aspects of the material that should help to distinguish it from paper.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
  <dd>
    <p>Papyrus is a paper-like material that was used over several thousand years, seeing its greatest popularity from 4th century B.C. to 4th century A.D as a writing support in Egypt, Greece, and Rome.  Papyrus production involves cutting or peeling the papyrus reed plant into long strips. Strips were then soaked, rolled, and placed into overlapping layers, then pressed and left to dry to form sheets or rolls. Starch paste may have been used to strengthen the cross-lamination of the layers. Superior grades of papyrus come from the center of the plant, which appears brown in color. Papyrus formed from strips of the outer edges of the plant will generally appear more yellowish-white.</p>
    <p>During the 19th and 20th centuries, many museums and private collectors in the west began to acquire papyrus artifacts. In this period, there were many that stored their papyrus items between glass sheets or that mounted them with acidic paper, films, and adhesives (Stanley, 1994). Unfortunately over time, these housing and mounting techniques proved detrimental to papyrus, causing staining, embrittlement, and irreversible changes to the artifact.</p>

  <h3>Preservation</h3>
  <dd>Regardless of quality, papyrus will lose flexibility over time due to its own acidic nature. Although proper storage, handling, and treatment should help to prolong its life, most ancient papyri will naturally be desiccated, discolored, and brittle due to its cellulose/lignin composition. Papyrus is a fragile material, and it can fracture or fray easily when under stress. It is also sensitive to high heat and humidity, and is prone to curling. Brittle and lifting surface fibers may also help to identify papyrus.</dd>
  <h3>Identification</h3>
  <dd>Papyrus can be easily identified by its characteristic grid pattern. The easiest way to identify papyrus is to examine a sheet by viewing light through it, holding it up to a light, or using a light table. The cross-laminated layers should then become apparent.</dd>
