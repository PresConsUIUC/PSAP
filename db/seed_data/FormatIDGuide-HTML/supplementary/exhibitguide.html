<h1>Exhibition Guidelines</h1>
<p><b>Summary:</b> Many cultural heritage institutions include display of their collections as part of their mission.  The importance of exhibiting objects must be weighed against the irreversible damage that is caused during display.  The longer an item is displayed—exposed to light and fluctuating environmental elements—the greater the risk of physical damage.  Therefore the duration of any exhibit should be determined in advance, and no item should be placed on permanent display.  Alternatively, consider using facsimiles, copies, or items of low artifactual value for long-term exhibits.</p>


<p>An ideal, safe exhibition duration is between 3–4 months for most items (Conn, 2012), assuming that other conditions such as light, temperature, and relative humidity are within acceptable ranges—but many institutions may find this goal unrealistic and will have to consider their limits.  Regardless of duration, between display periods an object should be returned to an appropriate storage environment, preferably in climate-controlled dark storage.</p>


<p>Light damage is irreversible, and accumulates gradually.  Color fading from light exposure is often difficult to recognize.  Taking time to measure UV light intensity in a given space is useful, and there are practical approaches that any institution can use to curb intensity and minimize exposure.</p>


<p>Light levels should be kept as low as possible.  When on display, objects should be protected from exposure to natural light, which contains high levels of UV radiation.  Shades, curtains, or filters applied directly to windows will help to minimize sunlight.   Natural light, fluorescents, and halogen lamps produce high UV radiation and will require filtering.</p>


<p>Display cases should be enclosed and sealed to protect their contents.  Consider lockable cases for high value items and monitoring exhibit space when visitors are present.</p>


<p>Framing and matting materials should be preservation-quality and known to have passed the Photographic Activity Test (ISO18916).  Mounts should be reversible, that is, capable to be undone; avoid tape and adhesives whenever possible.</p>


<hr>
<h2>Use of Facsimiles/Copies</h2>
<p>In order to minimize the inherent risk in exhibition, consider displaying copies.  This is an effective strategy for 2-D artifacts, especially for fragile photographs and unbound paper documents.  High resolution scanning, laser printing, and other modes of high-quality copying enable the creation of very convincing facsimiles for more fragile objects going on view.  Some organizations, however, may not find this to be a good fit for their mission or policies.</p>



<h2>Light</h2>
<p>Light exposure is the primary external threat to objects on display.  Exposure at any level is a threat, but a high level of intensity (e.g. natural light) at long intervals will be most immediately damaging.  The effects of light exposure are cumulative: short-term exposures at low intensity can add up to affect significant damage to an object.  And because this fading is gradual, it is often difficult to recognize before it is too late.  See Monitoring Light Levels below to learn about practical light measurement.</p>


<p>Light damage is irreversible.  Exposure will cause surface discoloration and severe fading that in most cases cannot be repaired.  For paper, light can also weaken the internal structure, weakening and embrittling its support.  All photographic materials are highly susceptible to light damage, especially color dye images. Many printing inks, writing and drawing media can altogether fade to nothing.</p>

<p>Avoid all ultraviolet light.  Invisible ultraviolet (UV) radiation is regarded as the true underlying threat, the most damaging of light frequencies (Dean, 1994).  Eliminate needless exposure to sources rich in UV output (i.e. sunlight, fluorescents, tungsten-halogen lamps). Begin with natural daylight.  When sunlight is a factor, place blinds, screens, and/or UV filters over the windows.  UV-filtering sheeting (plastic film) and panels (a plexiglass or glass) should have a blocking capacity of 90% or higher. UV-filtering products trade names include Plexiglas, Lucite, Acrylite, Lexan, Makrolon, and Perspex.  Check manufacturer specifications and be aware of color distortion and capacity ratings.</p>


<p>Artificial light sources should be switched off when visitors are not present.  Consider the use of dimmer switches.  UV filters are crucial in cases of high UV output. See Artificial Lighting below for information on fluorescent and halogen lamp UV output and filtering methods.</p>

<figcaption>μW/lm (microwatts per lumen) is a unit for UV light measurement; Derived from Michalski, n.d.</figcaption></figure><h3>Infrared Energy (Heat)</h3>
<p>Heat—generated primarily by sunlight and tungsten light—will be retained in closed cases and frame packages, causing significant harm to most exhibition items.  Paper and photographic materials can dry out, warp, discolor, and suffer structural damages.  Even with UV filters, these items will sustain damage from invisible infrared energy exposure.  This is all the more reason to avoid long-term and frequent exhibition.</p>




<h3>Artificial Lighting</h3>
<p>Regardless of the light source, it must be kept at the lowest level necessary (dimmer recommended; diffused light will go further) and should emit little to no UV:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Fluorescent</strong>: Fluorescent lights produce the most UV rays of any artificial source. Furthermore, they cannot be dimmed. But fluorescent lamps are common, relatively long-lasting, and low UV output tubes (0.5–2%) are available. Any tube intended for an exhibit space should be covered with a plastic UV-filtering sleeve. The sleeve should be long enough to cover both ends of the tube, from which much of the UV energy is emitted (Glaser, n.d.).  The filtering agent fades over time, so replacement of the sleeve will be necessary every 5–10 years (Casterline, 1980).</li>

<li>
<strong>Tungsten (Incandescent)</strong>: With little or no UV output and an ability to be dimmed, incandescents are considered suitable. However, incandescent lighting will generate significant heat.  Avoid placement in a display case or in close proximity to exhibition items.  Ventilation and distancing are best.  Use a dimmer; at full capacity, lights are needlessly bright and emit considerable infrared energy.</li>

<li>
<strong>Halogen (Incandescents)</strong>: tungsten halogen, quartz-iodine, quartz-halogen): Very common in museums today, halogen lamps can be dimmed and are qualitatively similar to incandescents. Unfiltered, these give off slightly more UV than most incandescents.  Before installation, lamps should be outfitted with the appropriate filters, which are often included with the fixture.  Bulbs labelled "UV-STOP" will emit far less. Halogen bulbs can generate high heat and are known to be combustible.</li>

<li>
<strong>LED</strong>: Increasingly popular in the museum community, LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) emit very low UV and little infrared radiation.  LED have a long lifetime.  Bulbs are slightly warm to the touch, so consideration should be given for enclosed environments.  Some take issue with its color rendering, so try before you buy, if possible.  LEDs have a tendency to flicker, so check at several settings with the appropriate switch and transformer.  In compact exhibit spaces, the dimmer’s level of control should be dependably high (Druzik &amp; Michalski, 2011). For more info regarding the use of LED lighting in exhibition spaces, see Druzik &amp; Michalski's <a href="http://www.connectingtocollections.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/SSL-Guidelines-Ver.-10.0.pdf" target="_blank">Guidelines for selecting solid-state lighting for museums</a>.</li>



<p>Simple and practical action should also help to curb light exposure.  Turn out lights when visitors are not present in the viewing area. Dim the lights. Cover displays with light-blocking cloth when closed.</p>


<h3>Monitoring Light Levels</h3>
<p>Light level measurement can range from the highly precise (and expensive) to low tech (and low cost), and there are many practical workarounds.  On the high end: light meters measure visible light, while UV meters (more expensive) measure invisible UV radiation.  If a UV meter cannot be procured, it is safe to assume sunlight, fluorescents, and halogen lamps will produce high UV radiation and will necessitate filters (Conn, 2012).</p>

</div>

<p>Another method of measuring light is through the use of Blue Wool tests, which demonstrate light damage to an array of blue-dye colourants in wool samples.  By observing dye fade from exposure to a given light level for a specific length of time, you can gain an idea of appropriate exhibition intervals—or convince others at your institution that endless exhibitions are in fact damaging your collections.  ISO’s Blue Wool cards are available from many archive material suppliers.</p>

</div>

<p>Many SLR film cameras and some DSLR (digital) cameras have built-in light meters capable of measuring light levels in a "scene."  Though the quality of through-the-lens light metering will vary, most will help to provide you with a scale of high and low intensities in your space.  Ultimately, for many institutions, these light readings do not necessarily have to be exact.  As is the case for many quick-and-dirty methods, you will learn that doing something—however small—is better than nothing at all; use the tools at your disposal to make the most informed decisions possible.</p>



<h2>Macro-Environments/Micro-Environments</h2>
<p>The best thing one can do to protect from seasonal shifts, pollutants, and particulate matter is to have a dependable heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system in place.  Filtration, AC, and dehumidification running on a 24-hour-a-day cycle will do more in the long run to protect items in your care than any high-end airtight enclosure could.  If air conditioning is not an option, strategic placement of fans and dehumidifiers are a workable substitute to mitigate extreme temperature and humidity in your space.</p>

<figcaption>Exhibition/Gallery Environment Recommendation</figcaption></figure><p>Also consider the control strength of your micro-environments: rooms, display cases, vitrines, or box enclosures (Dean, 1994).  A well-sealed case can be a decent buffer from humidity. But in seasons or geographic regions of high humidity, silica gel or similar desiccants or humectants can act to keep humidity in this microclimate at acceptable levels by absorbing moisture. Contact a supplier or manufacturer to learn more about what your unique environment will necessitate.</p>




<h2>Handling &amp; Preparation</h2>
<p>Certain items, such as photographs and film, should be handled while wearing white cotton gloves; this protects the emulsion and prevents fingerprints from being left on the image surface, which can oxidize and cause permanent damage.  Nitrile and vinyl gloves are a suitable, and often preferable, alternative to cotton gloves.  In most instances, white cotton gloves are not recommended for handling book and paper items.  They may snag on fragile pages, attract dirt and oils, and limit the user’s tactile experience.  Staff and patrons should simply wash their hands thoroughly before handling items, except in the case of photographs.  For most photographic materials (particularly those with an emulsion), it is best to wear nitrile gloves or archival cotton gloves so to prevent transfer of acidic oils onto the surface.</p>

</div>

<h2>Display Enclosures &amp; Materials</h2>
<p>Enclosures should be used to protect collection materials from airborne pollutants, physical contact, and the extremes of environmental shifts.  Be sure that your display enclosure is larger than the object to be displayed.  Never fold or trim an object to fit!  Display materials must also be chosen carefully.  Some woods, paints, sealants, adhesives, hardware, and display fabrics can emit harmful airborne pollutants affecting paper structure and photographic silver images. </p>


<h3>Wood Cases</h3>
<p>Wooden display cases are generally not recommended as they can pose a threat to paper materials due to the volatile off-gassing that results from their degradation.  However, sealing wood will help to reduce these gaseous emissions.</p>


<p><b>Sealants/Paints:</b> Avoid oil-based sealants and paints.  Always elect for low VOC (volatile organic compound) or non-toxic paints/sealants, if possible.  Recommended sealants and paints include (Glaser, n.d.):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Sealant</i>: Water-based polyurethane or two-part epoxy sealant</li>
<li>
<i>Paint</i>: Acrylic or latex paint, but first use two-part epoxy as sealant</li>
</ul>
<p>Wood Materials:  Plywood, fiberboard, other composite materials should be avoided as they are likely treated with acids, adhesives, and/or formaldehyde. Oak, the most naturally acidic of solid woods, must also be avoided.  Some softwoods, such as poplar and basswood, are admissible.  As a general rule, artifacts should not come into direct contact with wood surfaces, especially paper-based and photographic materials.</p>


<h3>Framing</h3>
<p>Even the most stable display item can be damaged if framed tightly with low-quality materials. UV-filtering glazing/glass is recommended for any framing package, especially those that block over 97% of UV energy.  Buffered (alkaline) mats and mounts are recommended, as frames tend to house items after exhibition.  Non-adhesive and hinge pressure systems using nonreactive paperboard are preferable.  Aluminum framing is ideal because it is inert.  Wood frames may be unavoidable.  If so, some sealing (PAT-approved) will be necessary.  Sealing the edge of the frame package from the wood frame material with polyester tape should help to limit harm of an off-gassing wood frame (Wilhelm &amp; Brower, 1993).</p>

</div>

<h3>Mounting</h3>
<p>All mounting techniques should ideally gently support the piece, should be removable, and should not alter the condition of the items they display.  Non-adhesive mounting is preferable, and tape should never be used.  Sheet items can be attached to rag paper (100% cotton paper) or other two-ply archival quality (acid-free) display backing cut to the same size or larger than the item.  Transparent corner supports (polyester photo corners and corner strips, available from most archival supply houses) or hinged window mats are commonly used to fix the item to the mount.  Exhibitors should use their own judgment, but most mount methods have well-documented standards.</p>

<div class="figure-gallery">
<figure><img src="images/mylar-mounting-corners_01-300.jpg" alt="Mylar corner mounts" data-has-retina="true" width="300" height="300"><figcaption>Non-adhesive corner mounts.</figcaption></figure>
</div>

<p>Avoid tape and adhesives if possible.  These materials often release acids, and should be assumed destructive to your collections, some "archival" tape or glue can also cause damage, so do your homework.</p>


<h3>Encapsulation</h3>
<p>Single sheet or thin pamphlet items may be encapsulated in polyester film, which helps to protect and structurally support objects.</p>


<p><i>Recommended Material(s)</i>: Uncoated polyester (Melinex type 516, Mylar type D)</p>


<p>Encapsulation should not be confused with lamination, which is inadvisable in any situation where long-term preservation is of concern (see <a href="laminationencapsulation.html">Lamination/Encapsulation</a>).  Encapsulation involves sealing the edges of two sheets of polyester to enclose an item, and allows for the item to be removed simply by cutting open the polyester enclosure.  Encapsulation methods include ultrasonic or thermal welding (ideal but expensive), zig-zagged cloth stitching, and double-sided tape (no. 415). The adhesive tape method is not recommended for heavy and/or thick items; also avoid adhesive tape in warm environments.</p>

<div class="figure-gallery">
<figure><img src="images/encapsulation-ultrasonic01-300.jpg" alt="Polyester encapsulation ultrasonic welded enclosure" data-has-retina="true" width="300" height="225"><figcaption>Polyester encapsulation, ultrasonic weld enclosure.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="images/polyester-lsleeve_01-300.jpg" alt="Polyester encapsulation L-sleeve with double sided tape" data-has-retina="true" width="300" height="300"><figcaption>Polyester encapsulation "L-sleeve" formed with double-sided tape on 3 of 4 sides. This method is not recommended for heavy or thick items, warm environments should also be avoided.</figcaption></figure>
</div>

<p>Highly acidic items are known to deteriorate more rapidly when in a polyester sleeve or other containment.  In such cases, deacidification or washing will have to be performed by a professional prior to encapsulation. In lieu of this conservation work, an alkaline buffer sheet may be placed with the object to slow the acid degradation.</p>


<h3>Display Cloth/Fabric</h3>
<p>Cotton, linen, polyester, and cotton-polyester blends are recommended over silk (acidic) and wool (emits sulphur compounds) fabrics.  Avoid wrinkle-free and fire retardant fabrics.  Wash any fabric before using in a display arrangement.  Dyed cloth should be washed until all dyes are removed.</p>


<h2>Security</h2>
<p>Objects are at heightened risk of theft when on display. Security measures can also be established in to prevent this at your institution.   Items of high value can be placed in locked display cases.  Also consider using secondary wall mounts/harnesses for framed items of high value.  The more effort it takes to remove from the wall, the less likely it is to be stolen or damaged.  If security staff is not a feasible option, consider introducing exhibit space monitor shifts.  Be aware of placement and visibility in your space when designing exhibits.</p>

<h2>Displaying Book/Bound Material</h2>
<p>Books and pamphlets should be "displayed horizontally or at a gentle angle" (Glaser, n.d.). Do not display an open book beyond its comfort angle, generally 30–45° (Nicholson, 1992). Anything else may cause warping or weakened binding.  Open volumes should never be displayed flat at 180°. A book cradle or wedge can be ordered to spec or can be fabricated in-house, typically molded acrylic, folded board, or polyethylene foam.  In addition to limited exhibition and item rotation, simply turning the pages regularly should curtail light damage and structural damage.</p>
