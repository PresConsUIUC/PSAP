<h1>Collection Development Policy</h1>
 
<p>No matter what size the institution—from an all-volunteer, small town historical society with limited financial resources to a nationally recognized museum with an annual budget in the millions of dollars—there are a great many benefits to a well-written, practical collection development policy.</p>

<p>A collection policy of this type defines the scope of an institution’s holdings, specifically by detailing <i>what</i> an institution (museum, library, archive, historical society, etc.) collects. Even more importantly, it also details <i>why</i> it collects certain things and not others. A good policy sets collecting priorities and thus improves the depth and breadth of items and objects in collections over time. A collection policy also enables an institution’s governing authority or board to fulfill its fiduciary and stewardship responsibilities.</p>
	
<p>It is often the case that well-intentioned, yet misguided donors will assume their local historical society collects any and all "old" books, photographs, maps, correspondence, and other items and objects, regardless of their condition or provenance. Yet no one institution can afford to accept donations in a haphazard manner. It would be a mistake, for example, for a small county historical society to accept any item or object from any time period or location. Storage space for most institutions (small and large, rich and poor) is usually at a premium, and such practices would place undue strain on staffing and financial resources.</p>

<p>A collection policy obligates an institution and its staff to ask questions integral to its mission, vision, ethics statement, and overall sense of purpose: Should a small town museum or library in Idaho, for instance, need to collect, preserve, catalog and store a large collection of photographs of the Manhattan skyline? What if the photos were taken by an amateur photographer who once lived in that Idaho town? A collection development policy can answer these and other questions, including: <em>Will this donation prove helpful to visitors making use of our resources?</em> <em>Will this donation help us better tell the stories we want to tell?</em></p>

<p>A common mistake when embarking on collection development is to draft a policy based on protecting (or giving precedence to) current collections regardless of their utility to the institution’s overall mission or purpose. Such an approach would only compound existing institutional biases. Once a clearly written collection development policy is complete and approved, be prepared to deaccession items and objects. Although it is often difficult to deaccession long-held material, hard choices can improve the cohesiveness of the remaining collection and create space for new acquisitions.</p>

<p>Finally although it may seem counterintuitive, the <em>process</em> of writing and implementing a collection development policy can be as important as the policy itself. This process can greatly improve staff and volunteer understanding and appreciation of the institution’s responsibilities to its "shareholders," including its governing authority or board, members, visitors, and the public at large.  An institution’s collection policy should reinforce and inform the institution’s mission or vision statement by providing answers to two basic questions: <em>Why are we here, and what are we trying to accomplish?</em></p>

<p>Each institution has unique collections and unique challenges and opportunities, and thus every policy will be likewise unique. That said, many collecting institutions have placed their development and/or management collection policies online. Examining other policies online or, better yet, talking directly with staff from peer institutions, will undoubtedly prove helpful. In addition, national organizations such as the American Alliance of Museums (AAM) and the American Library Association (ALA) have online guides to developing and managing collections:</p>
