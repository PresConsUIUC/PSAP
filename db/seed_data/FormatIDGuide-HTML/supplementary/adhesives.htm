<h1>Adhesives</h1>

 
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>
<p>An adhesive is a substance used to bond materials together superficially through chemical and/or mechanical means. The term "adhesive" is often used interchangeably with glues or pastes, but also may refer to tapes, especially with regard to paper-based formats. Adhesives are of natural or synthetic composition, and vary in bond strength, flexibility, deterioration rate, and degree of reversibility. Adhesives can also provide a sealing function. Historically, adhesives rendered from animal products, gum, or other plant resins were employed for a wide range of purposes, including the joining and mending of documents. In the 1920s, these natural adhesives were augmented by the development of synthetic adhesives. Over time, adhesives based on plastics, synthetic rubbers, and other elastomers (elastic polymers) emerged for commercial use. Since the mid-20th century, advances in the chemistry and plastics industry have created an array of synthetic polymer adhesives with specialized properties and purposes.</p>
 
<p>Information about adhesives presented here is intended to assist collection managers in identifying adhesive types, as well as to understand and evaluate the preservation risks associated with them. Adhesives should not be removed from nor applied directly to collection materials unless under the direction of a trained conservator.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Deterioration</dt>
<dd>
<p>Most adhesives will deteriorate over time. Their composition, as well as biological, and environmental conditions all factor into the stability of adhesives and their retention of original characteristics. Natural adhesives are generally weaker, more susceptible to mold and pest damage, and are often water-sensitive (unless rubber), and are therefore at risk in high humidity and water disasters. When rubber-based adhesives deteriorate, they oxidize, causing the adhesive to yellow and become oily and sticky. In this condition, the adhesive can penetrate into the paper entirely and seep onto adjacent sheets, causing staining. After permeating into the paper, rubber-based adhesives lose their inherent adhesive properties and may become hard, brittle, and highly discolored.  Though synthetics do not seep into paper fibers quite like natural adhesives, they can cause physical damage to documents through "cold flow," which causes the adhesive to seep, or "penetrate to the degree that paper porosity allows" even if under little to no  pressure (Smith, et al., 1983). Synthetic adhesives may contain unpredictable additives, and therefore should never be assumed inert.</p>
 
<p>Natural and synthetic adhesive deterioration manifests in a variety of symptoms including movement, discoloration, embrittlement, staining, and failure. Adhesives that have been exposed to water or high humidity may swell, structurally weakening the adhesive and producing acidic byproducts. Exposure to light and heat will accelerate deterioration as well.</p>
 
<p>Post-It® note adhesives leave behind residues that attract dirt and other airborne particulates. The adhesives will also lift some typewriter and electrostatic printing inks when placed over a printed area, particularly after a prolonged period.</p>

<dt>Preservation</dt>
<dd>In addition to chemical stability, reversibility is a desirable trait for adhesives used with collection materials. A reversible alteration must not harm valued objects and should allow the object to be returned to its original state. In this sense, adhesives that are water- and solvent-sensitive can at times be viewed in a positive light, assuming reversibility is desired.</dd>

<h2>Identification Characteristics</h2>

<h3>Adhesive Types</h3>
<p><em>Types listed below are <b>not mutually exclusive.</b> For instance, many tapes can be both pressure-sensitive and contain a synthetic polymer.</em></p>
 
 <dl>
<dt>Pressure-sensitive (PSA, self-adhesive; c. 1845–present)</dt>
<dd>An adhesive applied to some thin, flexible carrier that will bond with an object when pressure is applied, using moisture, solvent, or heat. The adhesive can be of natural or synthetic (after 1940s) polymer composition, though typically of acrylic or rubber. Examples include most common tapes (Scotch®; masking, packing, electrical, etc.) as well as self-stick notes (e.g. 3M Post Its®), stickers, and labels, etc. PSAs are not recommended for use on valuable materials.</dd>


<dt>Water-activated (or "gummed"; c. 1840–present)</dt>
<dd>These adhesives are activated, i.e. rendered sticky, through the application of moisture – typically water or saliva. Moisture can often reactivate adhesive and allow for the removal of the carrier (e.g. cloth or paper tape). Water-based adhesives are typically starch-based or animal glue-based and include "gummed" tape and some postage stamp adhesives.</dd>


<dt>Heat-sensitive (thermoplastic; c. 1894–present)</dt>
<dd>Thermoplastic adhesives are activated, i.e. rendered into a pliable and sticky liquid, when heated above a specific temperature. As it cools, it "sets," returning to its original solid form, though some may remain tacky at room temperature. Heat sensitive adhesives of this type are broad and include waxes, resins (natural or synthetic), some acrylics, and proprietary heat-set mending tissue adhesives.</dd>


<dt>Starch adhesives (1st century A.D.–present)</dt>
<dd>Starch adhesives are activated by soaking and/or cooking starch powders in hot water to form a paste. The most common starches used to make adhesives include rice and wheat. Starch adhesives are water soluble and are often used in the manufacture of paper and in paper conservation. Starch pastes are widely used in papermaking and paper conservation applications, as they are water-soluble and reversible. These pastes are pH neutral and remain stable over time under appropriate conditions. This type of paste, however, is susceptible to biological attack.</dd>
 
<dt>Methyl cellulose adhesive (c. 1912–present)</dt>
<dd>Methyl cellulose is class of cellulose ethers which can be formed into a low tack adhesive when mixed with water or various alcohols.  They are used predominantly in paper mending and bookbinding. It is considered relatively stable as it is pH neutral and easily reversible (water-soluble). In addition, it does not stain or discolor over time.</dd>


<dt>Vegetable adhesives (mucilage; 1st century A.D.–present)</dt>
<dd>In addition to vegetable starches, as noted above, mucilage, a thick, gluey substance produced by nearly all plants, has been historically used as paper adhesive.   Mucilage is water soluble and most often used as paper adhesive, as well as to adhere stamps and labels.</dd>
 
<dt>Animal glue (hide glue; c. 1700–present [on paper])</dt>
<dd>These adhesives are derived from animal bone, tissue, and skin and are available as a powder or pellet, hot melts, or in liquid form. Animal glues are water soluble before and after application and even after drying. Examples include fish glue, bone glue, hide glue, parchment glue, rabbit skin glue, and calf glue.  Animal-based adhesives are often used in packing, envelope, and bookbinding applications. When first manufactured, the glue appears as a clear yellow-brown. Over time, it breaks down, and will eventually discolor, darken, and embrittle. Aged animal glues discolor and may cause staining. Animal glues are also extremely sensitive to environmental fluctuations including humidity, airborne pollutants, and light and UV radiation.</dd>


<dt>Cellulose nitrate (common c. 1890–c. 1960; use persists today in areas)</dt>
<dd>Cellulose nitrate adhesives were used as a mending material in the late 19th century to repair art and archaeological objects. They contain plasticizers and are considered very unstable. Cellulose nitrate appears clear when first applied, but becomes severely discolored and brittle over time as its plasticizers fail. Cellulose nitrate also produces gaseous fumes that turn into corrosive nitric acid in the presence of moisture: a threat to others as much as to themselves.</dd>


<dt>Acrylic (c. 1920–present)</dt>
<dd>Acrylic adhesives are synthetic resins and may be found in pressure-sensitive tape and label applications as well as heat-set mending tissues and tapes and other modern adhesives.</dd>


<dt>Polyvinyl Acetate (PVA, PVAc; c. 1920–present)</dt>
<dd>PVA is a synthetic copolymer emulsion and is generally a viscous white or creamy yellow before use which dries clear. PVA is used in various craft, bookbinding and paper conservation applications. Examples: acid-free "archival" PVAs such as Jade (no. 403, 711), Rhoplex®, and Lascaux® acrylic. Polyvinyl acetate can also be in acidic products, such as woodworking glue, Elmer’s® glue, or "school glue." This adhesive class is perhaps the most common type of glue on the market as it is flexible, easy to use, and non-toxic. Bookbinders and conservators use acid-free PVA as a consolidant and as a glue in conservation treatments. PVAs offered by conservation suppliers are pH neutral, do not "off-gas" once dry, are believed to not break down over time, and are relatively light stable. This adhesive, however, is not easily reversible and is sensitive to moisture and humidity.</dd>


<dt>Rubber-based (c. 1920–present)</dt>
<dd>Synthetic or natural, or an amalgam of synthetic and natural rubber, with any variety of plasticizers, tackifiers, and other additives. Natural rubber-based adhesive is low strength and of high volatility. Natural will also exhibit more severe yellowing than synthetic. Examples include rubber cement, some masking tapes, acetate tapes, and cellophane tapes. Over a short period of time, rubber adhesives will turn yellow and cause paper staining. Once this happens, the adhesive becomes brittle and loses its adhesive properties. Rubber adhesives may also contain sulfur, which fades and stains the silver image of many photographic formats.</dd>

<h3>Carriers/Backings</h3>
<p><em>Many adhesives will be "carried" by some backing material (e.g. fabric, plastic film). Though tape and carriers/backings are not usually classified alongside adhesives, we are doing so here in order to give you the ability to identify the adhesives typically associated with each type of carrier/backing.</em></p>
 
<dt>Tape</dt>
<dd>
<p>Though not a genuine "carrier," tape is a common format that incorporates pressure-sensitive adhesives. The adhesive, typically acrylic- or rubber-based, is mounted on a flexible carrier made of fabric, plastic film, or paper. Tapes that are frequently encountered among documents include mending tapes, cellophane tape, and masking tape. Applications for tape include mending, hinging, and mounting.</p>
 
<p>Tape carrier deterioration is often seen in partnership with the deterioration of the adhesive (as described above).  Carriers of plastic film, in particular cellulose diacetate and vinyl, may shrink, discolor, become brittle and curl.  Paper carriers may discolor and become weaker over time.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Adhesive Sheets (laminate, contact paper)</dt>
<dd>Adhesive sheets are made from a combination of a thin sheet, such as paper or plastic film, and an adhesive, which allows the sheet to be adhered to another surface. Common types of adhesive sheets include plastic lamination sheets (e.g. cellulose acetate; see below) and contact paper sheets. Generally, lamination sheets are either self-adhesive or heat-sealed. Deteriorating lamination sheets may show signs of warping, bubbling, or splitting. Additionally, plastics may "off-gas", causing a chemical reaction with the material inside the lamination sheet and the adhesives which bond the two together. Most often the adhesives used in lamination are also acidic. Laminated objects are best stored at a constant relative humidity (at a set point [ideally ±2] between 30% and 50%) and temperature (55–68°F).</dd>
 
<dt>Cellulose Acetate (laminate)</dt>
<dd>From the mid-1930s through the 1970s, acetate film was commonly used to laminate fragile documents (and as a consolidant for flaking or friable media). Cellulose acetate can degrade catastrophically, leading to the absolute loss of the object it seals. The adhesives commonly paired with cellulose acetate may also oxidize and discolor to an orange-yellow.</dd>
 
<dt>Mending Tissue</dt>
<dd>Japanese paper (made of kozo, gampi or mulberry fiber) is a long-fiber paper often applied with a starch paste (and occasionally PVA) in conservation applications. Other mending tissues (and tapes) come prefabricated with acrylic adhesives that are pressure-sensitive (Filmoplast® P), heat-set (Crompton®, Filmoplast® R), solvent-set or water-activated. Though many of the prefab type are called "archival," this is an optimistic term as reversibility will vary. These papers are selected for preservation purposes due to their chemical stability and do not deteriorate rapidly unless acted upon by outside factors such as mold, high adjacent acidity, or physical stress.  Deterioration is most commonly seen in physical failure due to physical stress, or discoloration due to acid deterioration from adjacent materials.</dd>


<dt>Miscellaneous</dt>
<dd>"Self-sticking" articles (e.g. postage stamps, labels, and Post-It® notes) are also commonly made up of a paper backing and an adhesive. Often the paper backing used is low-grade and acidic. As such, the acid from the backing may migrate from adherent to the adherend. Additional deteriorative factors include humidity, light, oxygen, and over-handling.</dd>
