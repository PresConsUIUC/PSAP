<h1>Disaster Preparedness</h1>

<h2>Disaster Recovery Plan</h2>
<p>A disaster recovery plan establishes how an institution will respond to a range of disasters. Creating a plan involves risk assessment: asking what could go wrong, how likely is it, what would result? Review risks to your building and collections by systematically examining facilities from top to bottom and from outside in. Note areas where mitigation might prevent damage.The plan should delineate, among other things, how you will treat your materials if they are exposed to flooding, fire, smoke, storms, vandalism, building systems failure, and other disasters. Having a disaster plan in place before a disaster strikes can make your response much more effective and can potentially keep a bad situation from becoming much worse.</p>


<p>A disaster plan should include information about:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>How to prevent a disaster</em>. Monitor your facilities and mechanical systems. Provide staff with the necessary information that will help them to make informed decisions about the placement of materials and how to prepare for the worst (fires, floods, etc.).  For example, you might include information about the location of fire extinguishers and emergency response kits, and direct them to never store items on the floor or below exposed pipes.</li>

<li>
<em>When disaster strikes</em>.  Maintain an emergency contact list containing both staff and volunteer phone numbers and email addresses, along with a simple checklist of preemptive actions, e.g. move boxes, cover collections, sandbag the backdoor, etc.  In anticipation of a forecasted natural disaster, communicate with your staff and emergency volunteers to establish an accurate estimate of manpower as well as to give them fair notice.</li>

<li>
<em>Post-disaster recovery procedures</em>.  If a collection sustains water damage, there is a short amount of time to take action to prevent harm. Mold grows after 48 hours in environmental conditions above 65% relative humidity and 70°F; photographic materials need to be treated within 72 hours as photo emulsions may soften and dissolve; and stacked photos may meld together.</li>

<li>
<em>Materials requiring special protection or treatment, ideally as a prioritized list</em>.  This requires a high-level understanding of your collections. Of course your high priorities will include collection material of significant cultural and/or monetary value to your organization, but also your organization’s unique administrative records, catalogs, and/or finding aids.</li>

<li>
<em>Suppliers, conservators, and available services</em>.  There are many professionals better-equipped and at the ready to jump into action when there is little time to lose.  Keep a list of contact information for servicers and emergency responders both local and beyond.  Do the research now and form a relationship with these resource providers prior to disaster.  This will help your organization to act swiftly and effectively.</li>

<li>
<em>Staff and volunteer responders</em>.  In addition to an emergency contact list (with multiple phone numbers and email addresses), document information about staff’s general availability to determine the flow of communication (e.g. phone tree, emails, mass text messages) and inform scheduling in preparation for events.</li>
</ul>
<p>Make a concerted effort to keep the disaster plan current, especially when it comes to names and contact information.  Annual revision, redistribution, and group review of the document is a good strategy. The more copies out there—online, in print, in the hands of staff, in your building, and even at home—the stronger your organization’s line of communication will be when disaster strikes.  And perhaps just as important as having the plan is drilling and practicing the plan semi-regularly. It is crucial to keep the current plan readily accessible and familiar.  Disaster waits for no one.  The fate of your collections depend on your ability to act with vigilance.</p>


<p>dPlan and dPlan Lite are excellent online tools that can guide you through the process of generating a disaster recovery plan: <a href="http://www.dplan.org/" target="_blank">http://www.dplan.org/</a>.  A disaster plan should outline responsibilities and teams to whom they are assigned, along with alternate contacts. In the event of a disaster, flexibility will crucial as many will not be available. Also specify what materials have priority with regard to evacuation and recovery (NFPF, 2004). Using the PSAP to assess your materials can help you to generate a prioritized list of what materials will need attention in the event of a disaster.</p>




<h2>Format-Specific Recovery Plan</h2>
<p>Many photographic, audiovisual, and special collections materials will be particularly susceptible to incidental damages. When crafting a disaster plan, be sure to speak to the protection and salvage of these distinct, fragile items. Some basic tips to consider: first, do not store your valuable original materials in a basement or any area prone to leaking. Basements take on water during floods and storms; you want to make sure your materials are in a humidity and temperature-controlled environment—above the basement level, if possible. Secondly, when storing materials on shelving, and if a basement is unavoidable, it is best to keep the materials off of the bottom two or three shelves. This will help to minimize their exposure to flood waters. It is also a good idea to store materials as far from water pipes (particularly those in your ceiling) as possible to help prevent damage in the event of a water leak. Having fire extinguishers available nearby is also a good policy.</p>




<h2>Access to Disaster Recovery Tools</h2>
<p>In the event of a disaster, it is ideal to have contact information for the disaster recovery services at hand.  Maintain a current list for servicers and emergency responders both local and beyond.  Do the homework now; form a relationship with these resource providers prior to disaster.  This should help your organization to act swiftly and effectively.</p>

<h2>Audiovisual-Specific Disaster Recovery</h2>
<p>AV materials are often difficult, if not impossible, to treat in-house in the event of a disaster. To further complicate matters, the various formats have different needs in terms of disaster recovery and cleaning. It is best to turn the materials over to experts to avoid further damage. </p>




<h2>Fire Detection</h2>
<p>Fire is one of the most damaging disasters to a repository. Having fire detection systems throughout every storage facility is critical in order to help prevent loss. Good smoke detectors and heat detectors can alert staff before a fire gets large enough to set off the fire suppression system. This can give staff time to put out the fire before materials are exposed to the water or chemicals dispersed by the fire suppression system. Detection systems should be tested regularly to make sure they are functional.</p>




<h2>Fire Suppression</h2>
<p>Fire suppression systems are critical in a storage area. There are many types of fire suppression systems, but the most common are water sprinkler systems. Any system will have its benefits and drawbacks. </p>


<p>Water sprinklers are cheaper to install, maintain, and upgrade. However, repositories are often concerned about water sprinklers because it is assumed that these systems tend to turn all the sprinklers on in the event of a fire, causing more widespread water damage to collections than necessary. Research has proved this to be untrue, however; in fact, sprinkler systems tend to be able to focus their fire suppression very closely by turning on only a sprinkler or two over the fire (Artim, 1993).</p>

<p>In particular, there are two types of water sprinkler systems: the wet pipe and the dry pipe. The wet pipe system is the most common type as it is easier to install, maintain, and respond to fires. The dry pipe sprinkler system is used when the risk of pipe freezing is significant. These systems can be costly to install and are prone to corrosion and valve failure. In addition, their effectiveness is limited because of the delay in response, which is a critical factor. The first minutes of a fire are when it can quickly get out of control.</p>


<p>Halon systems have been preferred by many institutions because halon gas can extinguish fires without leaving any damaging residue. Halon systems were once widely used, but are no longer being manufactured due to environmental and safety concerns. Organizations with existing halon systems may use them, but they cannot be replenished. They were expensive to maintain as well; the supply of halon gas was costly to replace. Halon-protected rooms must maintain airtight seals as gas will flow to other areas of the building if there are passages.</p>

<p>Institutions should not fear water systems. When properly maintained, they can be very effective and minimally damaging to collections. Compared to fire, which can completely destroy collections, water damage to materials is often not the end of the world for your collections—there are many effective techniques for treating water damage and there are several excellent disaster recovery specialists who can help, should your sprinklers drench your materials.</p>


<p>Whatever system you choose for your institution, proper maintenance and upgrades are critical to maintain the long-term effectiveness of your fire suppression system. It is also very important that you check with your local building codes to see what you will be allowed to use in your facility. Some states or counties have laws that restrict the kinds of chemicals that can be used in your fire suppression systems.</p>


<p>Having easily accessible hand fire extinguishers throughout your storage facilities is critical when responding to a fire. Extinguishers should be recharged and/or inspected regularly to make sure they are functional.  Additionally, staff should be trained for correct usage of your particular fire extinguisher model(s)—as well as to know when not to use it.  Most important is personal safety: alert your fire department before anything else, and know when to just get out.</p>




<h2>Water Drainage</h2>
<p>Standing water can be very hazardous to your collections, especially those stored on the floor or on lower shelves. Water can break down materials and encourage mold growth. As a rule it is best to store materials up above the bottom two or three shelves in your stacks where space permits. It is also a good idea to have drains in the floors where practical so as to discourage standing water.</p>




<h2>Keep Materials off the Floor</h2>
<p>Placing materials directly on the floor can put them at high risk of danger should you have flooding in this storage facility. Flooding and water damage can be caused by Mother Nature but can also be caused by broken pipes or spills, so even if you do not live on a flood plain, you should still be concerned about water damage. It is a good idea to keep your materials not just up off the floor but on the higher shelves in your storage area, if possible.  In cases in which objects must be on or near the ground, consider use of buffering materials and/or risers to prevent direct damage. Bear in mind that many storage containers are often hygroscopic and water touching the bottom will wick up.</p>

<div class="figure-gallery">
<figure><img src="images/puddle-300.jpg" alt="Standing water on basement floor" width="300" height="200"><figcaption>Standing water on basement floor: an example of why not to store items on or near the floor. Even the wood pallet pictured here is undesirable as it can wick water from the floor and into the box.</figcaption></figure>
</div>

<p>In addition to basic preventative measure to minimize water damage, many cultural institutions also utilize water detectors to identify water leaks and provide an immediate alert. These sensors can be placed in basements or in other areas that may be prone to environmental or accidental flooding. It is advisable to regularly check the battery on these alarms.</p>


<h2>Security</h2>
<p>Vandalism and theft are real threats for any cultural institution. Protecting museum, libraries, and archives, however, is a complex issue as every institution varies in size, each with their own unique set of issues and needs. It is thus necessary for every institution to implement and maintain a comprehensive security program to ensure the safety of employees, visitors, and the artifacts. </p>


<p>The key to an effective security program is to have solid controls in place to aid in the protection, detection, and response according to the vulnerability of the assets and the access required. First and foremost, an integrated program should establish organizational measures and policies to include access/key control, guards, visitor regulations, entrance checks, and emergency preparedness and response. Keys should be issued strictly on an as-needed basis. There is no reason for every staff or board member to have to key to the storage areas, for instance. In addition, all security systems should should take into consideration the construction of the building. All areas of vulnerability—windows, skylights, fire escapes, loading bays, doors, drain pipes—must be assessed and protected. Drainpipes, for examples can be fitted with spikes, while window frames should be strongly constructed with locks that conform to national standards.</p>


<p>In addition to safeguarding the building, low-tech and high-tech systems should also be installed to assist security and protect the collections. The most important measure is to keep interior areas locked. Low-tech security measures include providing levels of access to the facility and collections, using staff and visitor badges, bag searches, maintaining a sign-in and sign-out sheet for all staff and visitors, and monitoring researchers as they use the collections. Other low-tech security measures include the use of barriers near entrances, such as turnstiles or revolving doors, stationing staff in exhibit areas to monitor activity, and securing display cases and works of art with locks, brackets, or hanging devices.</p>


<p>The use of high-tech security measures is also important in achieving an integrated security program. Ideally, an institution should utilize multiple devices to minimize risk while maximizing protection of the collections. These devices include intruder alarms, motion detectors, electronic locking systems, panic buttons, and CCTV cameras, which may deter potential theft or vandalism. It is important to note that these high-tech systems should be regularly maintained to prevent false alarms. </p>


<h2>Supervision and Theft Risk</h2>
<p>Keeping collections secure often means mediating public access to materials. The more control and supervision you have over your collection materials, the more you can protect them from damage. Circulating collections take the most abuse and are consequently the most potentially at-risk for damage. The following are levels of access control:</p>
<dl>
<dt><i>High control</i></dt>
<dd>These are collections that are kept locked away from public access. These materials are rarely, if ever, used and only by trained staff. The public cannot handle these materials. These materials are, as a result, at very low risk of theft.</dd>

<dt><i>Moderate control</i></dt>
<dd>These are collections to which the public has mediated access. Qualified researchers can access these materials in a monitored environment, such as a reading room or designated viewing/listening space. Researchers can handle items with proper restrictions and under supervision. These materials are at moderate risk for theft, as well as improper handling and use.</dd>

<dt><i>No control</i></dt>
<dd>These are collections that are stored in public areas. Researchers can access these materials in unmonitored environments. These materials are at high risk for theft, as well as improper handling and use. These are typically part of an educational collection, not a permanent or special collection.</dd>
