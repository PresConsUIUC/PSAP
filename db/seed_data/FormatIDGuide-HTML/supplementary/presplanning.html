<h1>Preservation Planning</h1>

<p>A preservation plan is a document that addresses the overarching preservation needs and approaches for the collection(s) in your care and considers what steps the institution must take to address these needs with the resources it has available or means to acquire. A plan should address the value of materials&mdash;where value may be monetary, curatorial, rarity, etcetera, or any combination of these&mdash;but should encompass all of the institution's collections to some extent, while prioritizing based on preservation need and value to the institution/collection. Preservation plans should be living documents, which grow and adapt over time as collections are added to the institution and institutional priorities change. Revision should occur every few years to accommodate accomplished goals and changing priorities and opportunities.</p>

<p>The PSAP can help with the formation of a preservation plan by giving you a deeper understanding of what collection materials are most at risk and, therefore, which collections require the most pressing preservation attention.</p>

<p>A preservation plan should describe the current state of a preservation program/initiative (or lack thereof), and acknowledge support and interest in furthering preservation efforts.  It should clearly outline prioritized preservation needs and available resources, policies, and operations that support those needs. Specifically, a primary purpose of the preservation plan is to establish near and long-term goals for the development of a preservation program/initiative. These goals should be prioritized for implementation in some manner, often by those obtainable with current staff and funding followed by those only obtainable with additional support&mdash;either through reallocated internal resources or external sources, such as grant funding.</p>

<h2>Format-specific Preservation Plans</h2>

<p>It may be useful to consider tailoring preservation plans or portions of a larger preservation plan towards certain formats in a collection(s) to develop preservation progress in a certain area.  Audiovisual materials especially may benefit by this approach because of their unique fragility and susceptibility to obsolescence. The PSAP (or AvSAP) can help you assess the AV materials in your collections so that you can make informed and targeted decisions in terms of what to conserve and reformat, and when. Similarly, early photographic materials or fragile reprographic processes may be evaluated using the PSAP to guide collection managers in setting meaningful goals for the preservation of these often unique or near unique collection materials.</p>
