<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>
<p>Transparency sheets are typically acetate, sometimes polyester (Mylar) and are found in many common document dimensions, printed on through an electrostatic toner process (laser printer or Xerox copier). Obviously plastic transparency sheets contain no cellulose fibers and are not technically paper. However, legal-sized plastic film transparencies (often used with overhead projectors) will often be lumped in with paper files.</p>

It cannot be easily torn and is considered chemically inert—despite some reported reaction to the diazo process. If stored in appropriate conditions, polyester may last over 500 years. Drafting film is commonly referred to by the trade name Mylar or Melinex. Some early drafting polyester matte coatings (1950s–70s) are known to flake; reformat these as soon as possible. Store all polyester film flat in acid-free folders. Interleaving with unbuffered paper may help prevent image transfer/loss.</p>

<dt>Deterioration</dt>
<dd>
<p>Depending on the age and type of plastic used, transparency sheets may become yellow or embrittled. In short, polyester sheets are more stable than acetate.</p>


<p>Acetate (1939–present; significant decrease in 1960s): Early acetates are especially prone to shrinking and may exhibit bubbling or "channeling" between layers due to disparate warping. Acetate with "vinegar syndrome" can infect other acetate-based materials stored nearby, particularly in a poorly ventilated storage area. Deterioration is hastened by high RH. Acetate film, if it is suffering from acetate decay, will emit an vinegar odor. Segregate acetate film in unbuffered paper sleeves. Do not enclose in polyester sleeves. Reformat if possible.</p>

<dt>Risk Level</dt>
<dd>Low to moderate, depending on type of material. Acetate, the more common, is at a significantly higher risk than polyester.</dd>
