<h1>Use &amp; Access</h1>
<p>Control, organization, and documentation will not only keep your collections safe, but will improve long-term accessibility into the future. Policies and regulations like those outlined below are a great start, beginning with the easiest of efforts to implement: careful handling and sensible management.</p>


<h2>Handling and Management</h2>
<p>Generally, unfettered use and handling of materials heightens the risk of damage to collections, be it through neglectful handling (e.g. touching photo emulsion with bare hands) or irresponsible operation of access equipment. This is a risk posed by patrons and staff alike, whether intentional or not.</p>

<p>Examples of neglect, mishandling, and mismanagement include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pressure-sensitive tape to mend tears;</li>
<li>Permanent or volatile inks to label documents (even the back side);</li>
<li>Folding materials to fit into a given box or enclosure;</li>
<li>Poor handling: use gloves (when handling sensitive emulsions) or wash and dry hands before handling (when handling fragile paper-based documents);</li>
<li>Inadequate packaging for shipping;</li>
<li>Lack of bibliographic control over holdings, leading to harmful and excessive use of unique or vulnerable items.  Instead introduce guides/finding aids for patron use.</li>
</ul>


<p>General recommendations: </p>
<ul>
<li>Folders, archival boxes, sleeves, and other enclosures to support and house materials;</li>
<li>Use only Photographic Activity Test (PAT)-compliant storage enclosure materials for valuable materials;</li>
<li>Wear gloves (cotton, nitrile) while handling archival photographic emulsion materials; </li>
<li>Avoid wearing gloves while handling fragile items (gloves hamper tactile senses and can lead to mechanical damage);</li>
<li>Use both hands and perhaps have someone help you when handling/moving oversized materials;</li>
<li>Use enclosures, book carts, and other equipment as appropriate to minimize risk to materials during transport.
</li>
<li>Only light pencils for direct labeling (e.g. on a photo verso);</li>
<li>Introducing guides/finding aids for patron use, including notes for proper handling of fragile materials;</li>
<li>Ensuring that archival staff, volunteers, and patrons are adequately trained in handling collection materials.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Cataloging / Description</h2>
<p>An undocumented or misrepresented collection may be especially vulnerable to theft, neglect, deterioration, improper storage, and deaccessioning. Typically, collecting institutions have formalized inventory control or finding aids. These may be created for internal inventory control purposes when an item/collection is accessioned. However, these accession records may not be authoritative, descriptive, or publicly searchable.</p>


<h3>Why is description critical to collection management?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Without descriptive data capturing key characteristics,all materials are at greater risk of misidentification, misplacement, and improper care.</li>
<li>Digital files are especially vulnerable to loss without descriptive data. These items cannot be visually browsed or skimmed like photos and other human-readable documents; they rely on machines for information retrieval.</li>
<li>Descriptive information makes items searchable for administrative and collection development purposes as well as for the end user’s research needs.</li>
<li>At a minimum, in order to make analog or digital items searchable, it is important to collect information about the object. Information such as a unique identifier, title, creator, date, format, collection size, access restrictions, and use restrictions (based on intellectual property and copyright issues) are key elements for access. At the very minimum, you should consider documenting this information.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Originals &amp; Copies</h2>
<p>Of course we must strive to maintain originals of the object (assuming the artifact has intrinsic value). In this arena, "original" refers to the earliest generation of an object. In some cases, it will come directly from a creator’s hand (manuscript) or straight from a capture device (photo negative). A commercially released book, postcard, or CD is not unique. In many instances, an organization will not know for certain whether it holds the true "original." You may have a film, photo, or document and have no idea if it is the earliest incarnation. In such cases, you must assume that it is the original and treat it as such. </p>


<p>Recommendations for care of original object:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ideally, originals should be used once to produce an access copy, facsimile, or surrogate;</li> 
<li>Copies would then be put to use by the institution in place of the original, sustaining the wear and tear of patron use or prolonged exhibition;</li> 
<li>These measures save the original from the wear and tear of use;</li>
<li>For audiovisual media, successive iterations of an AV object tend to have degrading picture and sound quality which is all the more reason to actively preserve the originals.</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your institution has a 16mm film, the best policy would be to transfer the film and allow the duplicate to be the viewing copy for the public;</li>
<li>Display a high-resolution reproduction print of a fragile paper document rather than place it in an unprotected exhibits case.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Digital Copies</h2>
<p>Digitization is the process by which digital copies of analog materials are made. Digitization is becoming increasingly critical as analog formats become obsolete. Making high quality digital copies for access purposes spares the originals from possible damage. However, a digitization program can be costly for an institution. This is one key reason to preserve your analog originals for as long as possible. Because digitization also takes time and effort, it is best to plan to digitize your materials over time, as part of your ongoing preservation workflow.</p>


<p>Digital formats have evolved quickly in a short period of time and continue to evolve. For this reason, the PSAP cannot recommend particular digital formats that are assured to be valid through the indefinite future. However, here are a few resources that can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Federal Agencies Digitization Guidelines Initiative (FADGI), Still Image Working Group (http://www.digitizationguidelines.gov/still-image/): outlines digital imaging frameworks and provides guidelines for sustainable formats.</li>
<li>Sustainability of Digital Formats, Libarary of Congress (http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/index.shtml): technical analysis of the file formats regarded as suitable for long term preservation.</li>
<li>JISC Digital Media: Choosing a File Format for Digital Still Images (http://www.jiscdigitalmedia.ac.uk/guide/choosing-a-file-format-for-digital-still-images): menu of image file formats, their factors, and the recommended applications for each.</li>
</ul>



<p>When choosing to digitize your AV media, here are some things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, you will need a playback machine for each format you wish to digitize.</li>
<li>Second, it is best to use non-proprietary digital formats, where possible. Since proprietary formats are owned by companies, if they are no longer supported, you could be stuck with a great number of digital objects and no software to play them with. You could be trading obsolete analog originals for obsolete digital surrogates.</li>
<li>Third, it is best to digitize your materials using uncompressed formats. Compression discards information from a file in order to make it smaller and more manageable. This allows sound and video files to be more accessible and easily shared online. The problem with compression, however, is that as information is discarded, it is lost from the digital copy; it is not possible to recover the information. For example, when a video is digitized and compressed, some color information (along with other information) is discarded to maintain a small file size. This color information is then not included in the compressed digital copy and cannot be recovered. For best practices when digitizing an audiovisual original, use uncompressed formats to make a digital master, which is the highest-quality digital copy possible. You can then make smaller, compressed digital "access copies" from the digital master.</li>
</ul>

<h3>A (Very Brief) Word on Digital Preservation </h3>
<p>It is important to remember that digital copies must also be preserved, which is no easy task. Digital objects face obsolescence at least as much as analog objects. As digital media evolve, older formats are sometimes discarded and can become difficult to support. For example, were you to have a WordStar document today, it would be hard to find a way to access that document. The PSAP does not address digital preservation, since it is a vast and burgeoning field and falls outside the scope of this tool. For our purposes here it should suffice to say that as you create digital surrogates of your analog originals, you will have to take steps to preserve those digital copies. Researching storage systems and digital formats will be critical to the long-term preservation of your digital materials.</p>


<h2>Ownership &amp; Copyright</h2>
<p>If you are unsure whether your institution owns the rights to a particular work, it is safest to operate under the assumption that you do not. Presently, the only materials without copyright protection are those in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain" target="_blank">public domain</a> and those where explicit permission has been granted by the rights holder. If you don't own the rights to an item and are unsure of who does, you may be able to locate the owner through the U.S. Copyright office by <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/records/" target="_blank">searching through the Copyright records</a>.</p>


<p><a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/108" target="_blank">Section 108</a> of the Copyright code currently provides archives and libraries with very specific and limited rights to duplicate materials for very specific preservation or access needs. However, Section 108 does not allow for unlimited duplication. For example, in the case of unpublished works, the library or archives must already have a copy of the work before preservation copies can be made. For published works, libraries and archives can only make duplicates to replace a copy it has or used to have in its collection, because the copy has been damaged, is deteriorating, lost or stolen, or the format has become obsolete (Harper, 2007). Additionally, copying can only occur after effort has been made to locate the item in a current, non-obsolete format at a reasonable price.</p>


<p>We strongly recommend you research section 108 prior to making duplication decisions so you are aware of your rights. Copyright laws are constantly in flux, so it is advisable to revisit the current status of the law to ensure that provisions have not changed. The <a href="http://copyright.lib.utexas.edu/" target="_blank">Copyright Crash Course</a> sponsored by University of Texas' Libraries is a good resource for copyright basics as they apply to libraries and archives. For general background, the <a href="http://www.copyright.com/content/cc3/en/toolbar/education/get-the-facts.html" target="_blank">Copyright Clearance Center</a> does a great job of explaining the many facets of copyright law. And of course, there is also <a href="http://copyright.gov/title17/" target="_blank">U.S. Copyright law</a> itself.</p>


<p>If you do not have the rights to perform preservation measures on an item and if you do not think you can procure those rights, then this item will score slightly lower in your decision list.</p>


<p>Copyright and intellectual property issues are thorny, especially when considering archival materials and copying. In general, copyright grants rights holders five exclusive right to their works:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reproduction (the right to make a copy of the work)</li>
<li>Distribution (the right to disseminate physical copies to others)</li>
<li>Public performance (the right to publicly screen, broadcast, or show film through various venues including on the Internet)</li>
<li>The right to prepare derivative works (for film, this generally means remakes or adaptations)</li>
<li>The right of public display (public display embraces the use of frame enlargements and the presentation of video in a museum exhibit)" (NFPF, 2004, p. 77)</li>
</ol>

<p>If your institution has secured a transfer of rights from a donor for a specific work, you still may not have the full right make the work accessible through digital systems or public presentation. In the case of film, there may be many underlying rights such rights associated with the music in the film or to the literary work on which the film is based In the case of audio works, some rights may be covered under federal law and also by state law. You may be able to provide access through the doctrine of <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html" target="_blank">Fair Use</a>; however, this is not a fail-safe way to circumvent copyright. Before copying and making materials accessible (especially if your intent is to provide access via the Internet), be sure to research what copyrights your materials are covered under, who owns the rights, and understand the provisions and risks associated with Fair Use.</p>



<h2>Allowing Audiovisual Playback</h2>
<p>It is a best practice for an institution to create duplicates of its AV media originals for access. Some institutions, however, will not have the time or the resources to duplicate their originals. In these cases, it is best to protect the originals from wear as much as possible. To this end, we recommend that you not allow your users to play back the originals without assistance from your staff. Playback machines can put stress on all audiovisual materials, even those that are in excellent shape. Your staff have more experience with your audiovisual materials and playback equipment and should handle and monitor playback for your users whenever possible.</p>


<h2>Allowing Loans to Institutions</h2>
<p>Any time originals leave your institution, they are exposed to risk. The rigors of shipping, including temperature and humidity variations, can be very hard on your collection items. When sharing your materials with other institutions, consider sending access copies instead, whenever possible. When materials leave your care, you have little to no control over how they are handled. It is best to keep your originals safely in your custody and the access copies with the borrowing institution.</p>


<h2>Allow Loaning to Others</h2>
<p>As previously stated, it is best to never let your originals out of your care. Should you decide to allow your users to take collection materials off the premises, it is best to send them with access copies.</p>
