<h1>Use &amp; Access</h1>
<p>Control, organization, and documentation will not only keep your collections safe, but will improve long-term accessibility into the future. Policies and regulations like those outlined below that establish levels of access and use are a great start to safe-guarding collections.</p>


<h2>Handling and Management</h2>
<p>One of the easiest areas to implement protections for collections is through careful handling and sensible management.  The unfettered use and handling of materials heightens the general risk of damage--be it through neglectful handling (e.g. touching photo emulsion with bare hands) or irresponsible operation of access equipment.  Whether intentional or not, this is a risk posed by patrons and staff alike.</p>

<p>Examples of neglect, mishandling, and mismanagement include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pressure-sensitive tape to mend tears;</li>
<li>Permanent or volatile inks used to label documents (even the back side);</li>
<li>Folding materials to fit into a given box or enclosure;</li>
<li>Poor handling: using gloves when handling delicate materials or not washing and drying hands before handling fragile paper-based documents;</li>
<li>Inadequate packaging for shipping;</li>
<li>Lack of bibliographic control over holdings, which has led to the harmful and excessive use of unique or vulnerable items.</li>
</ul>


<p>General Recommendations: </p>
<ul>
<li>Use folders, archival boxes, sleeves, and other enclosures to support and house materials;</li>
<li>Use only Photographic Activity Test (PAT)-compliant storage enclosure materials for valuable photographic materials;</li>
<li>Wear gloves (either cotton or nitrile) while handling archival photographic emulsion materials; </li>
<li>Avoid wearing gloves while handling fragile items since gloves can hamper tactile senses and lead to mechanical damage;</li>
<li>Use both hands and ask for assistance when handling/moving oversized materials;</li>
<li>Use enclosures, book carts, and other equipment as appropriate to minimize risk to materials during transport.
</li>
<li>Only use light pencils for direct labeling (e.g. on a photo verso);</li>
<li>Introduce guides and finding aids for patron use.  These can include notes on the proper handling of fragile materials;</li>
<li>Ensure that archival staff, volunteers, and patrons are adequately trained in handling collection materials.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Cataloging / Description</h2>
<p>An undocumented or poorly described collection can be especially vulnerable to theft, neglect, deterioration, improper storage, and deaccessioning. Although collecting institutions typically create formalized inventory controls and finding aids when an item/collection is accessioned, these accession records may not be authoritative, descriptive, or publicly searchable.</p>


<h3>Why Is Description Critical to Collection Management?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Without descriptive data capturing key characteristics, all materials are at greater risk of misidentification, misplacement, and improper care.</li>
<li>Digital files are especially vulnerable to loss without descriptive data. These items cannot be visually browsed or skimmed like photos and other human-readable documents.  Instead, they rely on machines for information retrieval.</li>
<li>Descriptive information makes items searchable for administrative and collection development purposes as well as for the end user’s research needs.</li>
<li>At a minimum, in order to make analog or digital items searchable, it is important to collect information about the object. Information such as a unique identifier, title, creator, date, format, collection size, access restrictions, and use restrictions (e.g. those based on intellectual property and copyright issues) are key elements for promoting and aiding access to your holdings. At the very minimum, you should consider documenting this information.  To best ensure the longevity and use of the information, it is also a very good idea to describe the collection or item using a common, well-known metadata standard (e.g. Dublin Core).</li>
</ul>


<h2>Originals &amp; Copies</h2>
<p>Assuming an artifact has intrinsic value, institutions must strive to maintain originals of the object along with its duplicates. "Original" here refers to the earliest generation of an object. In some cases, it will come directly from a creator’s hand (e.g. manuscript) or straight from a capture device (e.g. photo negative). A commercially released book, postcard, or CD therefore is not considered unique under this definition. In many instances, an organization will not know for certain whether it holds the true "original." You may have a film, photo, or document and have no idea if it is the earliest incarnation. In such cases, you must assume that it is the original and treat it as such. </p>


<p>Recommendations for care of original object:</p>
<ul>
<li>Originals ideally should only be used once in order to produce an access copy, facsimile, or surrogate;</li> 
<li>Copies are then put to use by the institution in place of the original, so that the copies sustain the wear and tear of patron use or of prolonged exhibition;</li> 
<li>These measures save the original from the wear and tear of use;</li>
<li>For audiovisual media, successive iterations of an AV object tend to have degrading picture and sound quality, which is all the more reason to actively preserve the originals.</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your institution has a 16mm film, the best policy would be to transfer the film and allow the duplicate to be the viewing copy for the public;</li>
<li>Display a high-resolution reproduction print of a fragile paper document rather than place it in an unprotected exhibition case.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Digital Copies</h2>
<p>Digitization is the process by which digital copies of analog materials are made. Digitization is becoming increasingly critical as analog formats become obsolete. Making high quality digital copies for access purposes spares the originals from possible damage. However, a digitization program can be costly for an institution. This is one key reason to preserve your analog originals for as long as possible. Because digitization also requires time, effort, and periodic maintenance, it is best to plan to digitize your materials over time as part of your ongoing preservation workflow.</p>


<p>Digital formats have evolved quickly in a short period of time and continue to evolve. For this reason, the PSAP cannot recommend particular digital formats that are assured to be valid through the indefinite future. However, here are a few resources that can help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Federal Agencies Digitization Guidelines Initiative (FADGI), Still Image Working Group (http://www.digitizationguidelines.gov/still-image/): outlines digital imaging frameworks and provides guidelines for sustainable formats.</li>
<li>Sustainability of Digital Formats, Libarary of Congress (http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/index.shtml): technical analysis of the file formats regarded as suitable for long term preservation.</li>
<li>JISC Digital Media: Choosing a File Format for Digital Still Images (http://www.jiscdigitalmedia.ac.uk/guide/choosing-a-file-format-for-digital-still-images): menu of image file formats, their factors, and the recommended applications for each.</li>
<li>PRONOM, The United Kingdom's National Archives (http://apps.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM/Default.aspx): technical registry of digital file formats, components, and software.</li>
</ul>



<p>When choosing to digitize your AV media, here are some things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, you will need a playback machine for each format you wish to digitize.</li>
<li>Second, it is best to use non-proprietary digital formats wherever possible. Since proprietary formats are owned by companies, you could be stuck with a great number of digital objects and no software to play them with if they are no longer supported. Plan carefully or you could end up trading obsolete analog originals for obsolete digital surrogates.</li>
<li>Third, it is best to digitize your materials using uncompressed formats. Compression discards information from a file in order to make it smaller and more manageable. This allows sound and video files to be more accessible and easily shared online. The problem with compression, however, is that as information is discarded, it is lost from the digital copy.  Once this is done, it is not possible to recover the information. For example, when a video is digitized and compressed, some color information (along with other information) is discarded to maintain a small file size. This color information is then not included in the compressed digital copy and cannot be recovered. For best practices when digitizing an audiovisual original, choose an uncompressed, lossless format (e.g. FLAC or WAV) to make a digital master copy of the highest possible quality.  You can then make smaller, compressed digital "access copies" from the digital master.</li>
</ul>

<h3>A (Very Brief) Word on Digital Preservation </h3>
<p>It is important to remember that digital copies must also be preserved, which is no easy task. Digital objects face obsolescence at least as much as analog objects. As digital media evolve, older formats are sometimes discarded and can become difficult to support. For example, were you to have a WordStar document today, it would be hard to find a way to access that document. Digital preservation, which is a vast and burgeoning field, falls outside the scope of PSAP, and therefore PSAP does not explicitly address issues of digital preservation. For our purposes here, it should suffice to say that as you create digital surrogates of your analog originals, you will have to take steps to preserve those digital copies. Researching storage systems and digital formats will be critical to the long-term preservation of your digital materials.</p>


<h2>Ownership &amp; Copyright</h2>
<p>If you are unsure whether your institution owns the rights to a particular work, it is safest to operate under the assumption that you do not. Presently, the only materials without copyright protection are those in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain" target="_blank">public domain</a> and those where explicit permission has been granted by the rights holder. If you don't own the rights to an item and are unsure of who does, you may be able to locate the owner through the U.S. Copyright office by <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/records/" target="_blank">searching through the Copyright records</a>.</p>


<p><a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/108" target="_blank">Section 108</a> of the Copyright code currently provides archives and libraries with very specific and limited rights to duplicate materials for very specific preservation or access needs. However, Section 108 does not allow for unlimited duplication. For example in the case of unpublished works, the library or archives must already have a copy of the work before preservation copies can be made. For published works, libraries and archives can only make duplicates to replace a copy it has or used to have in its collection.  Furthermore, these duplicates can only be made in cases where the copy has been damaged, is deteriorating, or was lost or stolen and where its format has become obsolete (Harper, 2007). Additionally, copying can only occur after effort has been made to locate the item in a current, non-obsolete format at a reasonable price.</p>


<p>We strongly recommend you research section 108 prior to making duplication decisions so that you are aware of your rights. Since copyright laws are constantly in flux, it is advisable to revisit the current status of the law to ensure that provisions have not changed. The <a href="http://copyright.lib.utexas.edu/" target="_blank">Copyright Crash Course</a> sponsored by University of Texas' Libraries is a good resource for copyright basics as they apply to libraries and archives. For general background information, the <a href="http://www.copyright.com/content/cc3/en/toolbar/education/get-the-facts.html" target="_blank">Copyright Clearance Center</a> does a great job of explaining the many facets of copyright law. And of course, there is also <a href="http://copyright.gov/title17/" target="_blank">U.S. Copyright law</a> itself.</p>


<p>If you do not have the rights to perform preservation measures on an item and if you do not think you can procure those rights, then this item will score slightly lower in your decision list.</p>


<p>Copyright and intellectual property issues are thorny, especially when considering archival materials and copying. In general, copyright grants rights holders five exclusive right to their works:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reproduction (the right to make a copy of the work)</li>
<li>Distribution (the right to disseminate physical copies to others)</li>
<li>Public performance (the right to publicly screen, broadcast, or show film through various venues including on the Internet)</li>
<li>The right to prepare derivative works (for film, this generally means remakes or adaptations)</li>
<li>The right of public display (public display embraces the use of frame enlargements and the presentation of video in a museum exhibit)" (NFPF, 2004, p. 77)</li>
</ol>

<p>If your institution has secured a transfer of rights from a donor for a specific work, you still may not have the full right make the work accessible through digital systems or public presentation. In the case of film, there may be many underlying rights such as rights associated with the music in the film or to the literary work on which the film is based. In the case of audio works, some rights may be covered under federal law and also by state law. You may be able to provide access through the doctrine of <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html" target="_blank">Fair Use</a>; however, this is not a fail-safe way to circumvent copyright. Before copying and making materials accessible (especially if your intent is to provide access via the Internet), be sure both to research what copyrights your materials are covered under and the ownership of those rights and to understand the provisions and risks associated with Fair Use.</p>



<h2>Allowing Audiovisual Playback</h2>
<p>It is a best practice for an institution to create duplicates of its AV media originals for access. Some institutions, however, will not have the time or the resources to duplicate their originals. In these cases, it is best to protect the originals from wear as much as possible. To this end, we recommend that you not allow your users to play back the originals without assistance from your staff. Playback machines can put stress on all audiovisual materials, even those that are in excellent shape. Your staff have more experience with your audiovisual materials and playback equipment, and they should handle and monitor playback for your users whenever possible.</p>


<h2>Allowing Loans to Institutions</h2>
<p>Anytime originals leave your institution, they are exposed to risk. The rigors of shipping--including temperature and humidity variations--can be very hard on your collection items. When sharing your materials with other institutions, consider sending access copies instead whenever possible. When materials leave your care, you have little to no control over how they are handled. It is best to keep your originals safely in your custody and the access copies with the borrowing institution.</p>


<h2>Allow Loaning to Others</h2>
<p>As previously stated, it is preferable to never let your originals out of your care. Should you decide to allow your users to take collection materials off the premises, it is best to send them with access copies.</p>
