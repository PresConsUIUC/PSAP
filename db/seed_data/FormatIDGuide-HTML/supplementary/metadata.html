  <h1>Metadata</h1>

  <h2>What Is Metadata?</h2>

  <p>All this talk about metadata, but what is it really? Basically, metadata is the data that helps build and provide a context for other data. Metadata is also often formatted in such a way that it is machine-readable, allowing data entered into one metadata standard to be shared outside of the home institution (e.g. MARC21) and to be interoperable with other institutions in some manner.</p>

  <p>The fundamental goal of metadata is to provide a means to insure the long-term preservation of information about an institution's collections. To this end, metadata standards dictate both a specific structure for organizing and presenting information and a specific set of controlled vocabularies and technical standards that determine best practices for the format of that information.</p>

  <p>To give a quick illustration of why both these aspects—format as well as structure—matter, let's say a string of numbers (1978-07-06) are identified as a date. Although the numbers are entered in a manner consistent with structural guidelines (i.e. they do correspond to a date), there is no way to know how to read that date without format guidelines. If you knew that the record was generated by a western European authority, you could guess that the day was entered before the month (i.e. the 7th of June). But what happens if you don't know who made the record or if you suspect that the record-maker was following American date conventions (i.e. making it the 6th of July)? By employing controlled vocabularies and technical standards, metadata schemas remove the uncertainty of data-entry in records and make data consistently and reliably legible.</p>

  <h2>Metadata Use in Libraries, Archives, Museums, and Cultural Institutions</h2>

  <p>Simply put, metadata entry is the practice of cataloguing in a digital world. The rapid development and adoption of digital information networks over the past several decades has created an endless stream of digital and analog data. While this has been a boon for education and research, it has created a demand not only for access to that data by an ever wider pool of users but also for a way to maintain and preserve that data in the long-term. This ceaseless production of new digital objects and information is produced by all sectors of society—the business world, government agencies, scientific communities, educational fields, humanities circles, and the arts. For the library and information sciences, this means that no matter what area one works in, metadata has become central to providing users the services and information that they need.</p>

  <p>Among the many reasons why academic libraries and archives will need to provide metadata on their collections:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>NSF, NIH, and NIJ grants now require data and datasets that they fund to be preserved for long-term access by a wide range of users</li>

    <li>Embedded librarians and archivists will be expected to give reference to academic patrons about how they can employ metadata in their research</li>

    <li>Researchers will need librarians and archivists to help them maintain their data and metadata at institutional repositories</li>

    <li>Researchers along with other users will expect librarians and archivists to help them access other institutions' raw data, datasets, and the accompanying metadata</li>

    <li>Researchers will expect librarians and archivists to provide instruction on how to integrate the data produced from their own work with that of researchers at other institutions</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In terms of asset and content management, metadata:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Improves preservation and conservation efforts of digital material in terms of processing speed and quality checks</li>

    <li>Helps maintain provenance authority by providing documentation for your collections—and any changes made to them—over long periods of time</li>

    <li>Manages citation, copyright, and licensing information for data</li>

    <li>Helps you and your users know what is in your collection and be able to find it</li>

    <li>Helps you literally access objects, such as by detailing the technological and hardware requirements for one to open and play a digital audio file</li>

    <li>Enables quicker searches of databases and datasets since keywords and tags can be generated as part of the metadata creation process</li>

    <li>Saves time since maintaining rich metadata records for scientific datasets and raw data promotes longer use of the same data</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Linked data connects collections to more users. For cultural heritage institutions, metadata in this way:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Helps more people and institutions to know about your collections (e.g. EAD)</li>

    <li>Enables more people to access your collection both in person and at a distance (e.g. TEI)</li>

    <li>Encourages collaborative efforts and resource-sharing between small and large institutions (e.g. OAI-PMH)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Metadata and PSAP</h2>

  <p>To encourage the use of metadata as a best practice for collection preservation and conservation, PSAP:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Generates metadata automatically</li>

    <li>Exports metadata as both EAD and Dublin Core</li>

    <li>Exports data from assessment reports as CSV and PDF files, which makes it compatible with ArchiveSpace and easy to integrate into many content management systems</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The metadata provided by PSAP can be used to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Figure out the costs for current preservation and conservation needs</li>

    <li>Make plans for ongoing maintenance and repair of your collections</li>

    <li>Save time and resources by documenting conservation and preservation efforts over long periods of time</li>

    <li>Help you make better informed decisions about levels of access for your collections</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Choosing and Adopting Metadata</h2>

  <p>When considering adopting a metadata standard, it’s important to remember that there is NOT one perfect metadata standard for any format or any collection. Instead, you will generally end up using several metadata schemas in order to properly catalogue the properties of your institution’s unique collections. In other words, you pick the right tools for the job at hand. You aren’t supposed to pick a single standard and then shoehorn what you’re cataloguing into fitting that standard.</p>

  <p>Another important consideration is that you don’t actually have to enter every bit of information that you have on an object. It is not necessary—and indeed can be counter-productive—to create an incredibly detailed record. You only need to provide information based on what you need—and what your users need—to know, preserve, and access.</p>

  <h2>Metadata Types: Descriptive, Structural, Administrative, Technical</h2>

  <p>There are four general categories of information that metadata standards capture about the objects that they describe. Most standards are designed to primarily address one category, but there are some that integrate more. Each type of metadata fulfills an important function in preserving collection materials and their digital surrogates for future use.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><em>Descriptive metadata</em> is the most like traditional cataloguing. It provides basic identifying documentation about an object, such as its title, physical measurements, and format.</li>

    <li><em>Structural metadata</em> provides information about how different layers or aspects of complex digital objects relate to each other.</li>

    <li><em>Administrative metadata</em> is concerned with maintaining and ensuring access to data over long periods of time. It is primarily focused on high level issues, such as information about copyright and use restrictions.</li>

    <li><em>Technical metadata</em> is similar to administrative metadata in that it seeks to provide long-term access to data. Yet, its main goal is to provide very granular information about materials, such as documenting the exact conditions in which the data was created and noting how data has been encoded.</li>
  </ul>
