<h1>Preservation Assessments and Surveys</h1>

<h3>What are Preservation Assessments and Surveys?  Why do they matter?</h3>
<p>Preservation assessments and surveys are a key element of good collection stewardship as they allow collection managers and curators to become more familiar with the condition of their collections and derive useful and accurate data about collections. This data helps managers to then establish and articulate preservation needs. In general, a preservation assessment considers many different facets of preservation need, ranging from the condition of specific materials to understanding how the building, environment, policies, and use all affect the health of the materials overall.  </p>


<h3>Whatâ€™s the difference between the two?</h3>
<p><strong>Preservation Assessments</strong>:  Most often, a preservation assessment evaluates the policies, practices, and conditions in an institution that affect the preservation of all or specific collections and considers the general state of the collections being evaluated, what is needed to improve that state, and how to preserve the collections long-term. It must identify specific preservation needs, recommend actions to meet those needs, and prioritize the recommended actions.</p>

<p>Typical components of a preservation assessment may include all or some of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Building/facility characteristics</strong>, including structure and maintenance;</li>
<li>
<strong>Environment</strong> of the building, including climate control, lighting, pests, housekeeping, fire protection, and security;</li>
<li>
<strong>Policies</strong> that affect preservation of collections, including emergency preparedness, disaster response, security, exhibit, circulation, and loan;</li>
<li>
<strong>Storage and exhibit areas</strong>, including shelving/case type and condition and shelving and exhibit practices;</li>
<li>
<strong>Condition</strong> of the collection, either through a sample or item-level survey;</li>
<li>
<strong>Storage and handling practices</strong>, including use of protective enclosures, shelving practices, and staff handling;</li>
<li>
<strong>Reformatting and repair options available</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Preservation Surveys</strong>:  By comparison, a preservation survey collects data on individual items to generate a broader understanding of the condition of materials.  Therefore, preservation surveys are often incorporated into larger preservation assessments or provide information that can develop short or long-term preservation plans for collections or entire institutions.</p>

<p>Surveys may be one of two types:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Condition surveys</strong>, which are designed to identify the physical condition of the collection in a specific manner, often combining observations on damage and deterioration with known use;</li>
<li>
<strong>Action surveys</strong>, which express the preservation needs of the collection in terms of actions that will secure, replace, protect, or treat the items examined.</li>
</ul>
<p>Surveys can look at every item in a given collection, or at a sample of a larger collection. The PSAP (and AvSAP) can be utilized for both item-level and sample surveys (See sample versus item level assessment document for specifics on these two approaches and the benefits and drawbacks of each). From the information collected, survey data can be used to generate preservation priorities, which can be combined with collection/curatorial priorities as shown below to arrive at a prioritized approach to preservation action.</p>
