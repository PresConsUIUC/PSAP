<title>Lamination v. Encapsulation</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Lamination vs. Encapsulation</h1>
<p>The terms "lamination" and "encapsulation" are often used interchangeably—and incorrectly so. Though it may sometimes be difficult to distinguish between encapsulated and laminated documents, there are clear differences between the two, in both appearance and intention. Specifically, lamination employs adhesives and is intended for use on materials with a short life expectancy and is not reversible; encapsulation does not use adhesives and is intended for long-term protection and is entirely reversible.</p>

<p>Lamination is the process of completely sealing paper documents between sheets of plastic with heat and low-grade adhesives. This is irreversibly damaging to the enclosed item. The conventional method is heat-seal lamination where documents or book pages are placed in plastic pouches and sealed using heat, pressure, and adhesives. Heat-seal lamination is irreversible as heat melts the adhesive into the document. This process is appropriate only for materials with a short term value—certainly not for your valued collection materials. Simply put, lamination should never be thought of as a preservation method.</p>

Use of heat-seal adhesive-based lamination is not recommended for preservation purposes.</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, lamination was once considered a viable conservation method (this is likely where lamination misconceptions originate) as it was thought to strengthen and protect fragile paper. Over time, however, it was discovered that lamination is in fact destructive. The application of high heat and pressure damages documents, while laminate plastics will "off-gas," causing a chemical reaction with materials sealed inside. Furthermore, the adhesives used in lamination are typically acidic. Inks also can be adversely affected, causing printed and written material it to bleed beyond its edges ("halo" effect). Each of these factors cause and/or accelerate the deterioration of paper documents.</p>

<p>Encapsulation is the process of completely enclosing documents between two clear sheets of uncoated polyester, sealed without adhesives, and therefore easily removed without adverse effects. These polyester sheets create an electrostatic charge which holds the document in place. The edges of the polyester are sealed or joined together (on all sides) using a variety of methods including ultrasonic, thermal, or laser welding (ideal but expensive), cloth stitching, or double-sided tape (3M no. 415). Double-sided tape should be approached with caution as adhesives can easily transfer to and damage enclosed documents that come into contact with the package edges; it is particularly bad for heavy and/or thick items.</p>

This method is not recommended for heavy or thick items; also not recommended for warm environments.</figcaption></figure><p>As encapsulation can be an expensive and time-consuming effort, this method of preservation is suitable for fragile documents, some photographic prints, certificates, and small textiles. It should also be noted that encapsulation is not recommended for artifacts with friable media (e.g. pencil, charcoal, chalk, color pencil) as the electrostatic charge causes the media to transfer onto the plastic. Photographic materials should be stored upright in a folder as to reduce the weight pressing the polyester film against the photographic emulsion.</p>

<p>Highly acidic items are known to deteriorate more rapidly when in a sealed polyester containment.  In such cases, deacidification or washing will have to be performed by a professional prior to encapsulation. In lieu of this conservation work, an alkaline buffer sheet may be placed with the object to slow the acid degradation. An uncoated polyester film, such as Melinex type 516 (previously marketed as Mylar type D, generically referred to as Mylar), is recommended for encapsulation.</p>
