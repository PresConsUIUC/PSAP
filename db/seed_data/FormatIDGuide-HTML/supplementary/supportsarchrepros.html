<h2><a id="paper-arch">Paper</a></h2>
<p>Paper supports of large-scale drawing reproduction will vary to extremes. Regardless of the paper’s function, tracing or printing, the basic composition is often similar. Semi-translucent tracing paper aided in the professional reproduction of technical drawings for decades before mechanical and chemical production and photo-reproductive processes (1880s) proliferated. The late 19th century brought about a wide array of surface textures, opacity, and tints. Quality also varied considerably in this period as wood pulp paper emerged as a cheap alternative to rag paper. By 1900, most paper was made from wood pulp, while rag paper (cotton, linen) was pushed to specialty markets.</p>

<p>Rag paper has longer fibers and thusly stands up better over time than wood pulp paper. Wood pulp paper has short, weak fibers (due to machine-pulping) further weakened by common sizing agents (i.e. alum-rosin). Due to a combination of factors (alum-rosin size, lignin, and residual processing chemicals), wood pulp paper produced from 1850 through the 1980s has a tendency to yellow and become extremely brittle over a short amount of time (exposure to light and/or heat will speed this degradation). By the 1930s, the acidic quality of wood pulp paper was widely recognized, and, since that time, has been gradually improved to the point that most papers and sizings are now chemically neutral or alkaline.</p>

<p>Working drawings/prints were often be mounted on muslin as a means of strengthening the paper support. The key degradation factor in such cases will be the adhesive. Masonite, cardboard, and foam-core are also common backings, usually used in display situations. Masonite and low-quality cardboard will also damage the paper. If left attached to the backing, in most cases, the drawing/print will become warped, embrittled, and/or stained.</p>

<p>Vellum paper is a stiff or coated semi-transparent paper, not actual animal skin. Specifically, it is a synthetic paper product made from plasticized wood pulp or cotton fibers: plasticizing agents have shifted from oils to resins to composites over time. The imitation vellum has an ivory or frosted quality, is semi-translucent, relative to thickness, and is available in semi-gloss and matte finishes. It is a modern support chiefly used for tracing technical drawings, plans, and plats. A thin sheet may be transparent enough to enable light-exposed copies to be struck from it. From the 1950s to early 1980s, vellum paper, along with polyester film (Mylar), was a predominant material for prints and drawings of this sort&mdash;and is more dimensionally stable than earlier paper or cloth supports. Vellum paper may also be referred to as vegetable vellum or Japanese vellum.</p>

<p>Vellum paper should be treated similar to drafting paper. Oversize drawings/prints are ideally stored in flat files, as rolling will easily lead to edge tearing. Place them in acid-free and lignin-free folders. Regardless of composition, be sure to interleave these papers with unbuffered, acid-free sheets in order to prevent resins or oils from spreading to others.</p>

<p>Drafting cloth is among the most common supports found in 19th and early 20th century architectural and technical drawing collections. Introduced in the 1850s, this flexible, durable alternative to paper was used primarily by architects and engineers for process drawings, tracings, and reprographic prints (e.g. blueprints, diazotypes). The fabric is typically cotton or linen, starched and calendered to create a smooth, glossy drawing surface. Over time, additional oil and plasticizer treatments improved translucency and water-resistance in drafting cloths. Prior to the 1880s, cloths had an off-white or natural color; after 1880, a bluish-white tint was common, due to a colorant used to increase transparency. Subsequently, blueprinting and similar processes became more popular, as increased translucency enabled more precise photo-reproductions to be struck. By the mid-20th century, drafting cloth fell out of favor after the emergence of synthetic drafting film (acetate, polyester). Regardless of composition, some refer to all drafting cloth as drafting linen, or simply "linen."</p>

<p>Because media (pencil, ink, etc.) rests on the the starch or finish on the surface, the drawing/print should be protected from water and high humidity, as exposure to either could cause media to bleed, smear, or migrate.</p>




<h2><a id="plasticfilm-arch">Plastic Film</a></h2>

<p>Plastic drafting film has been used since the 1940s, but was a preferred support from the 1980s through the 2000s (Lowell & Nelb, 2006). Drafting films will have a matte finish on one or both sides, which gives the surface "teeth" to accept media (pencil, ink) or emulsion. Like other translucent supports, drafting film may be used alternately for original drawings or as a reproductive intermediate. Reproductions were likely run through a diazo machine. Stability will largely depend on composition.</p>

<h3>Acetate (1939&ndash;present; significant decrease in 1960s)</h3>
<p>Early acetates are especially prone to shrinking and may exhibit bubbling or "channeling" between layers due to disparate warping. Acetate with "vinegar syndrome" can infect other acetate-based materials stored nearby, particularly in a poorly ventilated storage area. Deterioration is hastened by high RH. Acetate film, if it is suffering from acetate decay, will emit an vinegar odor. Segregate acetate film in unbuffered paper sleeves. Do not enclose in polyester sleeves. Reformat if possible.</p>


<h3>Polyester, or Mylar (c. 1950&ndash;present; popular after 1970)</h3>
<p>Debuting in the 1950s, polyester became the standard film material in the 1970s. It cannot be easily torn and is considered chemically inert&mdash;despite some reported reaction to the diazo process. If stored in appropriate conditions, polyester may last over 500 years. Drafting film is commonly referred to by the trade name Mylar. Some early drafting polyester matte coatings (1950s&ndash;1970s) are known to flake; reformat these as soon as possible. Store all polyester film flat in acid-free folders. Interleaving with unbuffered paper may help prevent image transfer/loss.</p>
