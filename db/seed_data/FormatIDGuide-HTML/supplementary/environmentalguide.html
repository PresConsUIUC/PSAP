<h1>Environmental Guidelines</h1>
<h2>Climate Control</h2>
<p>The physical environment&mdash;and the ability to control it&mdash;should be the highest priority of any collecting organization. This encompasses balanced temperature and humidity, regulated light sources, clean and well-circulated air, and preventive measures against pest infestation and water exposure. An HVAC (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) system the ideal mechanism for much of this, and is most cost-effective with regard to long-term preservation. But HVAC installation and repairs can be very expensive&mdash;perhaps too much for some organizations. See Control Mechanisms below for more.</p>
<p>Regardless of an organization’s financial resources, one can easily monitor and even manage environmental conditions with even a the most modest budget. The work that you put into your building’s envelope and climate control mechanisms has a direct and significant impact on the life-long health of your collection materials. With this in mind, always strive to maintain communicative relationships with your facilities and maintenance staff. Convert them to the preservation way of thinking whenever possible.</p>
<p>See the sections below and Exhibition Guidelines for practical steps to improve both macro- and micro-environments. If nothing else, simply try to keep most collection materials in an environment that most people would be comfortable in (65&ndash;68&deg;F). But, of course, a colder and drier climate is almost always an improvement, so this means moving your materials out of the hot attic and the damp basement, if possible.</p>
<h2>Environmental Monitoring</h2>
<p>A monitoring program will allow you to establish a baseline for your environment and its typical conditions.  From this data you can infer deterioration rates of your collection materials, the risk of mold outbreak, and likelihood of pest infestations. As a result, your organization will benefit from having hard data to improve policy and environment control measures. <em>Environmental monitoring is the single most important thing you can do to sustain the life of your collections.</em></p>
<p>A full-scale environmental monitoring program should be comprehensive, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Temperature</strong>: Establish an average temperature and the allowable annual variance.</li>
  <li><strong>Relative humidity (RH)</strong>: Establish an average relative humidity and the allowable annual variance (RH is the amount of moisture [water vapor] held in the air, expressed as a percentage of the maximum amount that the air could hold at the given temperature).</li>
  <li><strong>Pest populations</strong>: The goal is not to eradicate all pests. Instead, integrated pest management (IPM) can be your first line of defense (see Mold/Pests below). Establish a normal, healthy range for your facilities throughout the calendar year and then continue to monitor fluctuations to make targeted adjustments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other environmental considerations include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Light levels</strong> (visible light and UV light): Monitoring light levels (daylight and artificial lighting) will not necessarily be a sustained action (unlike temp., RH, pests), but results should be considered each time collections are shifted to a new environment (e.g. exhibitions).</li>
  <li><strong>Pollution levels</strong>: Monitoring contaminants is a relative rarity; valid pollutant monitoring requires gas analyzers and other expensive gear. Instead one can make sure that HVAC system’s filters are changed often to mitigate the effects of airborne pollutants.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Monitoring Equipment</h3>
<p>The quality and prices of equipment varies considerably. Though some tools have emerged as the industry standard for a given function (i.e. PEM dataloggers), keep in mind that any one of these methods below will be effective so long as you are checking and recording results consistently.</p>
<p>Temperature and RH:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Datalogger</li>
  <li>Hygrothermograph</li>
  <li>Portable hygro-thermometer</li>
</ul>

<p>More than high-end equipment, trained and attentive staff will go a long way in the effort to monitor across facilities and across collections spaces. Getting people to recognize the importance of a balanced and well-documented environment is the most crucial first step.</p>
<h2>Temperature</h2>
<p>Regulating temperature (along with humidity) is crucial for lengthening the viable lives of your collections. High temperatures will accelerate the rate of material deterioration.  All damaging environmental factors are exacerbated by heat and humidity, including inherent internal flaws (residual chemicals) and external threats (air pollutants) alike. For example, photographic emulsions, prints, and writing media will oxidize more quickly, color dyes will fade more drastically, and acidic papers will yellow and embrittle at accelerated rates.</p>
<p>Temperature and humidity will have a mutual effect on one another.  "Within certain ranges, a lower temperature can compensate for a higher RH and vice versa" (Roosa, 2002).  The preservation community recognizes this (see ISO 18911; Image Permanence Institute), and, in lieu of recommending rigid temperature and RH limits, has championed target storage climate options. For example, at a cool-moderate temperature, the RH range may be 20&ndash;30%, while freezing conditions could allow for a broader range between 20&ndash;40% or more broad, depending on the materials.</p>
<p>Variations in temperature can cause your materials to expand and contract which can age these materials over time. It is best to keep temperatures in your facilities as steady as possible so as to lengthen the viable lives of these items. Even if you cannot maintain the ideal storage temperatures for your materials, it is still helpful to minimize the variances as much as you can.</p>

<p>Remember that optimal temperature ranges are just that: ideals. They might not reflect what you are able to accomplish in your storage facilities, but the closer you can get to these conditions the better. Keep in mind that variations in temperature are what we are really trying to avoid. Keeping your materials at steady temperatures, even if imperfect, will still help grant them longer life. You should also consider how to arrange your collections. Since different formats have different needs you may consider how you can store them separately so as to properly match an item with an environment. Don't be discouraged! These conditions should be the goal that you are moving toward, even if you can't always achieve them.  For more specific environmental conditions based on formats, see the respective profiles in the Format ID Guide.

<h2>Humidity</h2>
<p>Extreme highs, extreme lows, and fluctuating humidity will have a negative effect on materials.  Relative humidity (RH) is a measure of how saturated the air is in an environment.</p>
<ul>
<li>A high RH will generally cause materials to swell and misshapen, as well as make conditions favorable for pest and mold growth/damage.</li>
<li>A low RH often causes materials to desiccate, shrink, crack, and curl.</li>
<li>RH fluctuation beyond 10% above or below a set point begins to put materials under considerable strain and at great risk, as the components will often react incongruently, e.g. photographic support and emulsion contracting and expanding at different rates.</li>
<p>As with temperature, rapid fluctuation is the real threat, speeding up chemical deterioration and bringing stress to collection materials over time. It is best to keep the humidity across your facilities as steady as possible. Even if you cannot maintain the best possible relative humidity levels for your materials, it is still helpful to minimize the variances as much as you can.</p>
<p>Generally, it is best to keep collections between 30% and 50% relative humidity. It is important to remember, however, that often when you lower the temperature, you raise the relative humidity. This is why it is critical to monitor humidity and temperature in your storage facilities. Bringing materials out of uncontrolled environments like basements, sheds, and attics and moving them into climate controlled areas like internal rooms or even closets can do much to keep these materials viable.</p>

<h2>Control Mechanisms: Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning</h2>
<p>The best thing you can do to protect from seasonal shifts, pollutants, and particulate matter is to have a dependable heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system in place.  Filtration, AC, and dehumidification running on a 24-hour-a-day cycle will do more in the long run to protect items in your care than any high-end airtight enclosure could. In addition to regulating temperature and humidity, a modern HVAC system should also filter particulate matter from the environment. Just remember to change filters on a regular basis.</p>
<p>For many, however, the cost of purchase and installation of an HVAC system in an existing space is prohibitively expensive.  Room-size air conditioning units may be an achievable alternative. Temperature control will make relative humidity more easily manageable.  If air conditioning is not an option, strategic placement of fans and dehumidifiers are a workable substitute to mitigate extreme temperature and humidity in your space. Do not open windows, however, as this would allow unfiltered contaminants and organisms into the environment.</p>

  <figcaption>General Environment Recommendation</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Also consider the strength of your microclimates. Do not place your collection materials near the window, against exterior walls, on or near the ground, if possible.  A well-sealed case can be a decent buffer from humidity and accidental leaks or spills. In seasons or geographic regions of high humidity, silica gel or similar desiccants or humectants can act to keep humidity at acceptable levels by absorbing moisture in these more enclosed areas. Contact a supplier or manufacturer to learn more about what your unique environment will necessitate.</p>
<p>To learn more about environmental control practices with regard to collection storage, see the <a href="https://www.imagepermanenceinstitute.org/" target="_blank">Image Permanence Institute</a>’s Environmental Management research and publications.</p>


<h2>Mold and Other Pests</h2>
<p>High temperature and humidity also heighten the potential for mold growth.  Once mold takes hold of materials, especially photographic materials, it is nearly impossible to remove without permanent damage to the visual information. It is best to stay well below 60% RH and below 75&deg;F in order to prevent mold and fungi outbreaks.</p>
<p>Insects and rodents, in one form or another, will undoubtedly exist in comfortable climate controlled environments. The first thing you must do is accept this&mdash;learn to look beyond the errant mouse or cockroach to see their occasional presence as normal. For the sake of collections and personal health, consider a defense alternative to fumigation and the use of harmful chemicals.</p>
<p>Integrated pest management (IPM) is a proactive method designed to pinpoint potential pest infestation areas or whether there are facilities maintenance or operation issues that need to be improved to reduce the likelihood of a full infestation in the future. This approach essentially treats pests as symptoms of greater environmental control shortcomings (e.g. compromised building envelope, policies, HVAC system failure).</p>
<p>By monitoring pest populations across the most sensitive areas of your facilities, you can determine acceptable insect levels to anticipate season-by-season (may take 1&ndash;2 years to establish). Once a baseline has been set, staff might then be able to point to sharp upticks in a particular area, and make a strong case (with hard data) for more meaningful and lasting repairs.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="http://museumpests.net/" target="_blank">Museum Pests</a> by the Integrated Pest Management Working Group (IPM-WG) and the University of Illinois Library Preservation’s <a href="http://www.library.illinois.edu/prescons/services/ipm/index.html" target="_blank">Integrated Pest Management program</a>.</p>
<h2>Light Levels</h2>
<p>Light exposure is the primary external threat to objects on that are on display (see Exhibition Guidelines).  Exposure at any level is a threat, but a high level of intensity (e.g. natural light) at long intervals will be most immediately damaging.  The effects of light exposure are cumulative: short-term exposures at low intensity can add up to affect significant damage to an object. And because this fading is gradual, it is often difficult to recognize before it is too late.</p>
<p>Light damage is irreversible. Exposure will cause surface discoloration and severe fading that in most cases cannot be repaired.  For paper, light can also weaken the internal structure, weakening and embrittling its support.  All photographic materials are highly susceptible to light damage, especially color dye images. Many printing inks, writing and drawing media can altogether fade to nothing.</p>
<h3>Measuring Light Levels</h3>
<p>Light level measurement can range from the highly precise (and expensive) to low tech (and low cost), and there are many practical workarounds.  On the high end: light meters measure visible light, while UV meters (more expensive) measure invisible UV radiation.  If a UV meter cannot be procured, it is safe to assume sunlight, fluorescents, and halogen lamps will produce high UV radiation and will necessitate filters (Conn, 2012).</p>
<p>Another method of measuring light is through the use of Blue Wool tests, which demonstrate light damage to an array of blue-dye colourants in wool samples.  By observing dye fade from exposure to a given light level for a specific length of time, you can gain an idea of appropriate exhibition intervals&mdash;or convince others at your institution that endless exhibitions are in fact damaging your collections. ISO’s Blue Wool cards are available from many archive material suppliers.

<figcaption>Blue wool tests</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>
<p>Many SLR film cameras and some DSLR (digital) cameras have built-in light meters capable of measuring light levels in a &quot;scene.&quot;  Though the quality of through-the-lens light metering will vary, most will help to provide you with a scale of high and low intensities in your space.  Ultimately, for many institutions, these light readings do not necessarily have to be exact.  As is the case for many quick-and-dirty methods, you will learn that doing something&mdash;however small&mdash;is better than nothing at all; use the tools at your disposal to make the most informed decisions possible.</p>
<h2>Gaseous Pollutants and Particulate Matter</h2>
<p>Airborne pollutants initiate chemical reactions that may stain and degrade support/base materials, accelerate the fading, staining, or loss of photographic, print/writing media (e.g. sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, and ozone cause oxidation in silver images and contribute to silver mirroring or yellowing).</p>
<p>Sources of pollution can include: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Emissions from the facilities</li>
  <li>Facilities cleaning chemicals</li>
  <li>Furniture and decor materials (e.g. rugs, window curtains)</li>
  <li>Environmental systems</li>
  <li>Office equipment</li>
  <li>Collection materials</li>
  <li>High traffic (people)</li>
  <li>Other external sources</li>
</ul>
<p>Gaseous pollutants include sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, ozone, acidic fumes, ammonia, and peroxides, just to name a few.  Particulate contaminants are very fine solid or liquid particles that may lead to the soiling and abrasion of material surfaces. Particulates can include dust, dirt, and aerosols; dust (i.e. human skin, fibers, pollen) may also attract pests. Particulate matter are more easily removed from the environment by filtration systems. Most HVAC systems and furnaces have filters that help to mitigate the effects of airborne pollutants; these will need to be changed regularly.</p>

<h2>Water Exposure (disasters or otherwise)</h2>
<p>Water damage, irrespective of the cause, can cause:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Paper staining</li>
  <li>Aqueous coloring/colorant bleeding,</li>
  <li>Coated papers and photographic materials alike to block or stick together,</li>
  <li>Photo emulsion to delaminate,</li>
  <li>Pest populations to rise, and</li>
  <li>Rapid mold growth.</li>
</ul>
<p>Water damage can be minimized with the appropriate disaster planning and response infrastructures in place. See Disaster Planning/Recovery for more information.</p>
